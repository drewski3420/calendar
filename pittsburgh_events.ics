 with support tba  $18 ADV / $20 DOS 7PM DOORS / 8PM MUSIC ALL AGES  BIO: A
  far cry from the cool\, calculated distance and reserved posture that is 
 all-too-familiar to the indie-rock sphere\, Florry\, the Philly-bred septe
 t and songwriting vehicle of bandleader Francie Medosch\, are marking thei
 r territory as a band resolving to do something very different: they are h
 aving a really good time out there.  Cutting her teeth in the Philadelphia
  DIY scene starting in 2019 as a student at Temple University\, the early 
 days of Florry found Medosch at the end of her teenage years releasing a s
 lew of singles and EP’s in a familiar idiom of lo-fi bedroom recordings 
 tinged with country melancholy. A lot has changed since then. Most importa
 ntly\, perhaps\, the project snowballed into a barn-burning seven piece ro
 ck band in the proceeding years\; and without sacrificing any of the emoti
 onal immediacy that's come to define Medosch’s brashly earnest\, bleedin
 g-heart lyrical style\, you’re unlikely to find her lingering as much on
  the melancholy these days. Or\, as Medosch plainly puts it in regards to 
 Sounds Like... \, the band’s forthcoming LP:  “The Jackass theme song 
 was actually a really big influence on the new album”  The release of th
 eir 2023 formal full-length debut The Holey Bible (via Dear Life) found Me
 dosch now flanked by six bandmates and trafficking in a wider\, more rock-
 oriented approach with the bravado of someone with a new lease on life. Wi
 th Jon Cox (Sadurn\, Son of Barb) on pedal steel\, John Murray on electric
  guitar\, Colin Dennen on bass\, Will Henrikson on fiddle\, Katya Malison 
 (Doll Spirit Vessel) on Vox\, and Joey Sullivan (Bark Culturr) on drums\, 
 Florry 2.0 had arrived. The retooled seven-piece embraced a lengthy run of
  tours dialing in their new kinetic sound and freewheeling chemistry inclu
 ding runs with Fust\, MJ Lenderman\, Greg Freeman\, and Real Estate. Greet
 ed to critical acclaim upon its release\, with positive notices from outle
 ts including Pitchfork\, Stereogum\, Paste\, and Brooklyn Vegan\, the albu
 m quickly introduced Florry to an expanded audience and pointed a way forw
 ard for Medosch and the band at a time when the future wasn’t so clear. 
  “I had a job lined up selling insurance\, I guess I figured that was th
 at\, you know?”  As it turns out\, that was not that. A few days went by
 \, and then the phone started ringing. From managers\, from booking agents
 \, from indie-rock elder statesman Kurt Vile\, who took the band on the ro
 ad in support of his 2023 Back to Moon Beach LP.  On the winkingly titled 
 Sounds Like... \, the band’s second full-length release via Dear Life\, 
 Florry is picking up right where they left off in 2023. Again upping the a
 nte with a bigger\, brighter\, more abrasive sound that resembles somethin
 g closer to Rolling Thunder Revue-era Bob Dylan than their humble DIY root
 s. Across ten tracks\, the band wear their influences on their sleeve whil
 e carving out a space that is distinctly their own\, blending raw honky-to
 nk grit and rich instrumental textures with the disarming sincerity and in
 timacy of the group’s lo-fi beginnings. It’s a record about searching
 —searching for home\, for love\, for meaning\, and for a sound that capt
 ures it all.  As Medosch croons on the red-hot opening track\, First it wa
 s a movie\, then it was a book  Last night i watched a movie the movie mad
 e me sad ‘cause i saw myself in everyone how’d they make a movie like 
 that?

 KROOM with support from VYVA MELINKOLYA  $16 ADV / $20 DOS 7PM DOORS / 8PM
  MUSIC ALL AGES  BIO: Cloakroom released their last album “Dissolution W
 ave” into the world on January 28th\, 2022\, commemorating their 10th an
 niversary as a band. The trio spent the months that followed embarking on 
 a number of tours\, growing together as a cohesive unit and pushing the bo
 undaries of what could be accomplished in a short amount of time together.
  At one point\, the troupe traveled from Chicago to Salt Lake City and bac
 k in a mere six days\, playing six shows in the process and traveling no l
 ess than 600 miles a day. As the calendar flipped to 2024\, Cloakroom laun
 ched on their most ambitious schedule to date\, playing 27 shows across Eu
 rope in just over four weeks time. While this is being written\, the band 
 is resting their bones after a 34 date North American run that was complet
 ed in 37 days.  By their own standards\, their new album ‘Last Leg of th
 e Human Table’ is a couple of years early. After an upstate New York eve
 ning spent with Closed Casket Activities owner Justin Louden\, the group a
 greed upon a deal to work together with the label on their next LP. Initia
 lly setting out to test the waters with a four-song EP\, Cloakroom booked 
 three days at the famed Electrical Audio studio in Chicago in December of 
 2023 and set out to write a batch of new material. The composing sessions 
 between singer/guitar player Doyle Martin and bass player Bobby Markos pro
 ved more fruitful than expected though\, and soon the band was faced with 
 the dilemma of picking which songs to include on an abbreviated release an
 d which to save for the future long play.  No doubt inspired by their hect
 ic touring schedules\, Cloakroom decided to set out on tracking an entire 
 LP in the three days of booked studio time while on the way to Chicago. Af
 ter a few long nights of rehearsing and writing with drummer Timothy Remis
 \, the group entered the house that Albini built with longtime collaborato
 r and engineer Zac Montez to begin tracking the ten song effort. Through a
  rigorous work schedule over the next 72 hours\, the band was able to capt
 ure the skeleton of the album before driving to Kalamazoo\, Michigan and F
 ort Wayne\, Indiana for a couple of end of the year gigs. The band would r
 ound out the week by spending some time at Rec Room Studios in Palos Hills
 \, Illinois to lay down some overdubs and further complete the record.  
 “Last Leg of the Human Table” is not a post-apocalyptic record or a wo
 rk of science fiction like Cloakroom’s previous LP. If Dissolution Wave 
 was a space western following an asteroid miner protagonist\, Last Leg bri
 ngs the observer back to Earth where most things are not as they’re crac
 ked up to be. For Cloakroom the world of modernity is in polycrisis and Am
 erica has lost its soul. Narrative fetishism is all too usual of a literar
 y mechanism for Cloakroom. If you listen closely you can hear the concern\
 ; not just for the teetering social structure but for what it means to be 
 human and the high cost of the human experience.  T.S Eliot’s ominous 
 “not with a bang but a whimper” has gotten a lot of traction in a post
 -pandemic world\, maybe even too much one could say. That whimper is just 
 tinnitus to Cloakroom\; here is the sound of a furnace that can’t stop r
 unning. That tonal resonance plays in-between songs on Volume 4 of the ban
 d’s discography. Recorded at Chicago’s staple Electrical Audio\, there
  could not be more of a hallowed space to capture this body of work. Every
  song is a different sound working together to showcase Cloakroom’s genr
 e-bending capabilities and seemingly vast array of influences\; whether it
  be the sampling of the post-disco Detroit group Was (Not Was) or the lift
 ed NASA recording of the humming of Saturn’s rings. Engineer Zac Montez 
 (Turnover) whom the band has referred to as an integral part of the band o
 nce again aided in smoothing out the rough parts and turning up the quiet.
   The album is truly sonically inspiring. Shoegaze\, doom\, post-punk\, fo
 lk just scratch the surface on the band’s shortest yet seemingly most su
 bstantial release to date. “Last Leg of the Human Table” can sound sar
 donic in its nature and it probably is\, but this group has always found s
 ome wonder in the scurrying chaos of modern life. In 37 minutes\, the albu
 m almost imbues a sense of responsibility to the listener as if one leg we
 re to falter the whole table will fall.  One the topic of the album’s fi
 rst single “Bad Larry”\, the band had this to say: Is he a bad guy? I 
 think Bad Larry is a reluctant protagonist. Society is already crumbling a
 round him (us) and to operate in this vast grey area one must be bombarded
  with a lot of tough decision making\; it’s always been this way. This i
 s another Cloakroom song written in a folk tradition. I think of the track
  “Diamond Joe” whose origins are a bit unclear but I think the first r
 ecorded version was by the late great Jimmie Rodgers in 1929. It’s a sha
 me that society rewards the unreasonable but at the same time it’s compe
 lling and challenges me to think about how to be just in an unjust world. 
 Diamond Joe or Sanford Clark’s “Buddy” give you a chance to contempl
 ate the allure of the outlaw much like modernity is fascinated with post-a
 pocalyptic living\; as if the world isn’t bad enough.  I affectionately 
 called this long-haired black cat “Bad Larry” I’d see ever so often 
 on my property. Couldn’t get near him\, he’d rear up and hiss like a c
 obra. It was his most endearing quality. He definitely was eating snakes a
 nd squirrels and song birds out here\, drinking out of mud puddles. He’d
  made it through a couple of winters\, but I haven’t seen him in months.
  I’m sure the life expectancy of an outside cat is cut in half to that o
 f an indoor but Larry sure burned bright. I’d like to think that Larry a
 nd Diamond Joe are also capable of kindness\, the duality of man\, that ki
 nd of thing. Sometimes I’d think about taming Larry and getting all the 
 burrs out of his tail and if the vet said Larry was a lady I’d name him 
 “Loretta.”  With “Last Leg of the Human Table” finally releasing i
 nto the world\, the band seeks some hard earned rest and hopes to raise en
 ough album sale royalties to fix the heat in the beloved tour van “War S
 led”.

 ES  for fans of... Best Coast\, Cherry Glazerr\, illuminati hotties  BIO: 
 Colleen Green is a DIY singer-songwriter and visual artist from Lowell\, M
 A.  Following the release of her classic debut album "Milo Goes to Compton
 " in 2010\, Green started to make a name for herself in the lo-fi bedroom 
 pop scene of Los Angeles. She soon became known in punk circles across the
  country for performing alone on stage with nothing more than a drum machi
 ne\, a pair of sunglasses\, and her iconic electric guitar.  In September 
 of that same year\, Green signed with Seattle-based Hardly Art Records\, a
  subsidiary of the legendary Sub Pop label\, and went on to release 2015's
  "I Want to Grow Up" which brought her international renown and critical a
 cclaim from the likes of Rolling Stone\, Pitchfork\, and the New York Time
 s. Following the success of this album\, the readers of LA Weekly voted he
 r Best Solo Act of 2015.  Green's pride and joy is the full-album cover of
  Blink 182's Dude Ranch that she released in 2019. The recording has since
  become beloved by fans of both acts and even led to a guest appearance on
  Mark Hoppus's Apple Music radio show.  She has performed in 20 countries 
 including Brazil\, Chile\, Japan\, Italy\, Spain\, Poland\, Czechia\, and 
 Norway.  The past 10+ years have seen Green continue to grow\, learn\, and
  improve\, and she hopes to keep following that trajectory indefinitely by
  staying cool\, being nice\, and believing in love.

 3-2025-570413\n  ANOTHER MICHAEL & KEEP FOR CHEAP with support from VIREO 
  $15 ADV / $18 DOS 7PM DOORS / 8PM MUSIC ALL AGES  for fans of... Big Thie
 f\, Great Grandpa\, Ratboys  ANOTHER MICHAEL BIO: Something very special h
 appens in the moment when a listener truly connects to a song. It’s an i
 ntangible reaction that bridges science and emotion\, turning firing synap
 ses into something cosmically beautiful. Another Michael exists for that m
 oment: when a song transforms the setting of a long walk home\, or speaks 
 to a past experience while simultaneously making a new one\, or taps into 
 something universal by relating details so specific and personal that they
  could only be revealed in music. In 2023 the band released Wishes To Fulf
 ill\, the first in a pair of albums dedicated to their love of song\, and 
 now they’re back already with the experimental next chapter\, Pick Me Up
 \, Turn Me Upside Down. Together\, the dual LPs create and pay tribute to 
 the power of transcendent musical moments.   Wishes To Fulfill and Pick Me
  Up\, Turn Me Upside Down are contrasting but complimentary albums: musica
 l siblings that are undeniably different entities but still share key soni
 c DNA. They each offer a plethora of dynamics\, feelings\, and moods to so
 undtrack the richness of life\, and form Another Michael’s finest work t
 o date. Where Wishes To Fulfill was a lean 29-minute set of single-worthy 
 tracks\, Pick Me Up\, Turn Me Upside Down is more expansive\, patiently un
 folding to reveal an exploratory side that brings new hues into the band
 ’s vibrant sound.   Helmed by lead singer/songwriter Michael Doherty and
  producer/bassist Nick Sebastiano–along with signature contributions of 
 multi-instrumentalist/vocalist Alenni Davis\, drummer Noah Dardaris\, and 
 longtime engineer/co-producer/confidante Scoops Dardaris–Pick Me Up\, Tu
 rn Me Upside Down came to life over three years of intermittent writing an
 d recording sessions that proved unexpectedly fruitful. The band decamped 
 at Headroom Studios in Philadelphia\, PA\, as well as the same Ferndale\, 
 NY house where they made their debut LP\, 2021’s New Music and Big Pop (
 which drew critical acclaim from the likes of Pitchfork\, Stereogum\, Bill
 board\, Paste Magazine\, and many more) with the intention of making one a
 lbum\, but creating enough material for two. “The longer we spent in the
  studio\, the more songs Michael wrote and we fleshed out together\,” ex
 plains Sebastiano. “Since we were creating music with no end-date in sig
 ht\, there was a certain aura of playfulness and experimentation inherent 
 in our sessions.”  That feeling of openness became the key to Pick Me Up
 \, Turn Me Upside Down. Another Michael’s core sound–ultra-catchy melo
 dies delivered through inventive chord progressions\, lush arrangements\, 
 and Doherty’s distinctive voice–is still present\, but the record feat
 ures new ingredients that push the music into unexpected directions. “I 
 think the idea of a good song is always changing for me\,” Doherty says.
  “The creative processes or personal listening experiences I’ve had ar
 e always meant to give me a deeper understanding of that.”   The album d
 raws on a wide range of influences\, from clear cut classics like The Beat
 les\, to contemporary luminaries like Alex G\, to the unexpected\, like a 
 strong inspiration from Sesame Street. “You can tell the musicians who w
 orked on the show were given so much freedom because the songs go to so ma
 ny places\,” explains Doherty. “There’s a great compilation called 
 ‘The Count’s Countdown’ where Count plays a radio host and is just p
 laying music from all over the show and it’s so unpredictable. All of th
 at encouraged me to keep the songwriting as free and unpredictable as we c
 ould.”   The songs on Pick Me Up\, Turn Me Upside Down often take the kn
 ack for melody that defined Wishes To Fulfill and apply it to left turns l
 ike the hypnotic quasi-krautrock of “I’ve Come Around To That\,” the
  sparse balladry of the title track\, or the pulsating synth explorations 
 of “The Diner’s Spoon.” The album’s world is weirder and more impr
 ovisational\, like in the twisting ends of “Hub of Dreams” or the spon
 taneous performances of “Like I Won A Car”–but Doherty’s warm sing
 ing and conversational lyricism always keep things grounded.   The unbridl
 ed creativity filters into Doherty’s words as well\, making it clear tha
 t the importance Another Michael prescribes to music truly permeates their
  existence. It’s the lens through which they see the world\, coloring bo
 th the smallest most mundane moments as well as the biggest and most impac
 tful. Doherty draws vignettes of everyday life and innermost emotions with
  equal attention to detail\, often grappling with living in an increasingl
 y chaotic and overwhelming world. “There’s motifs that point to an und
 erlying ‘American’ theme. American cities\, baseball\, Disney\, capita
 lism–and all the anxieties that go along with existing in a society that
  is proud of itself for what’s on the surface\, and exhausted by its dif
 ficulties underneath\,” explains Sebastiano.   Another Michael’s adora
 tion for music allows for simple sonic satisfaction\, but it also taps int
 o something deeper\, something connective. “Music is a medium of communi
 cation\,” says Sebastiano\, “It’s not a purposeful decision to talk 
 about music in our songs but it just inherently means so much to us. If so
 mething makes your heart sing\, the audience is going to hear it.” On Wi
 shes To Fulfill and Pick Me Up\, Turn Me Upside Down\, the band didn’t s
 et out to capture the all encompassing\, existential value of music\, but 
 they did contribute to it–offering more songs to the world\, and with th
 em\, chances to create one of those moments.    KEEP FOR CHEAP BIO: Keep f
 or Cheap’s special blend of indie\, country\, rock\, and pop has a littl
 e something for everyone. Playing what they call “prairie-rock\,” the 
 Minnesota five-piece will make you feel like a kid\, then break your heart
  without skipping a beat. On their debut album ‘Bundle’\, released Jun
 e 2022\, the band strives to make music that moves\, with driving instrume
 ntals and poignant lyrics that beckon you forward. Their debut LP ‘Bundl
 e’ pines over queer love and passing youth\, exalts the wonders of the n
 atural world\, and begs for connection wherever it can be made.

 nge icons\, how would you follow up NEVERMIND\, now that you've been comfo
 rtably embraced by the mainstream?   How about by hiring Steve Albini\, a 
 guy who once called you "R.E.M. with a fuzzbox"\, and letting him run wild
  in the studio with the most abrasive and uncommercial sound he can get ou
 t of you.   From the sound wall that opens SERVE THE SERVANTS\, it's obvio
 us that this isn't a trend chasing cash grab. Sure\, it has it's mega hit 
 (the Guitar Hero staple HEART SHAPED BOX)\, but this is an ALBUM\, not a g
 reatest hits collection - so what better way to celebrate it than LIVE\, I
 N FULL\, and IN ORDER - rightfully hearing the way Nirvana (and Steve) wan
 ted you too - loud\, pissed off\, and unfolding infront of you.  We've got
  the extremely talented SLEEPING WITCH & SATURN taking the stage for this 
 one\, plus a few bonus tracks after.

 IC ALL AGES  for fans of... Wild Pink\, Florry\, Merce Lemon  BIO: Music f
 or sleeping and waking\, walking and driving\, hunting and fishing\, for l
 oitering outside a roadhouse on the haunted tundra. Okay in elevators\, no
 t great for dinner. On Caveman Wakes Up Friendship’s new album and secon
 d for Merge Records\, the band’s historically capacious definition of co
 untry music grows wider still. Shambolic guitars are offset by flute pads\
 , bleary poetry is set against a Motown rhythm section\, a song about Jerr
 y Garcia and First Lady Betty Ford fades out with a drum solo\, like if Ta
 lk Talk came from a dingy Philadelphia basement\, and was fronted by James
  Tate. Songwriter Dan Wriggins’ ragged baritone cuts through eleven murk
 y\, swirling country-rock songs with profound lyrical substance and sincer
 ity. Like an alarm clock incorporated into the edge of a dream\, Caveman W
 akes Up belongs equally to the conscious and subconscious mind\, fraught w
 ith background\, steeped in reference and experimentation\, delivered casu
 ally and as a dire warning\, dedicated\, above all\, to music’s creative
  soul.  Over the years\, dedication has paid off. Friendship has become a 
 kind of reverse supergroup\, wherein the band itself and each individual m
 ember is located centrally in an increasingly prominent scene of young fol
 k and country musicians and songwriters. Drummer Michael Cormier O’Leary
  leads the instrumental collective Hour and\, along with bassist Jon Samue
 ls\, run Dear Life Records\, home to friends and peers who count Friendshi
 p as a major influence\, including MJ Lenderman\, Florry\, and Fust. (Samu
 els also plays lead guitar in MJ Lenderman and the Wind). Guitarist Peter 
 Gill’s band 2nd Grade records prolifically. Wriggins began writing the s
 ongs of Caveman Wakes Up on a downtuned classical guitar of Lenderman’s\
 , and finished on a barely-tuned piano in an apartment he shared with Sadu
 rn’s G DeGroot.  In the summer of 2023\, Wriggins had just left the Iowa
  Writers’ Workshop\, where his love for poetry and mistrust for the acad
 emic poetry world grew in tandem. A relationship fell apart\, and Wriggins
  crashed for several weeks at Lenderman’s and Wednesday’s Karly Hartzm
 an’s home in North Carolina\, where he recorded the first demos of “Re
 sident Evil\,” “All Over the World\,” and “Love Vape.” Wriggins 
 returned to Philadelphia\, and the band got to work on new ideas\, finally
  tracking the album in five days with engineer Jeff Ziegler (Mary Lattimor
 e\, War on Drugs). Wriggins recorded vocals with Love the Stranger enginee
 r Bradford Kreiger\, and organ\, violin (Jason Calhoun)\, and flute (Adely
 n Strei) were recorded by Lucas Knapp in a West Philadelphia church.  Lyri
 cally\, Caveman Wakes Up covers familiar Friendship ground — the sacred 
 is profaned and the profane sanctified. On “All Over the World\,” a la
 ndscaper “[feels] the beating heart of God/ laying down a roll of sod.
 ” Characters complain about work and marvel at love. Here\, however\, we
  get Wriggins’ first real confrontation with depression\, in “Hollow S
 kulls\,” “All Over the World\,” and “Resident Evil\,” where the 
 soul wages its perpetual war against darkness and stagnation. It often los
 es. The verses of Hollow Skulls are punctuated by passages of musical empt
 iness\, a single suspended chord and brushes on a snare drum. When Wriggin
 s complains about a roommate\, shouting “who’s that shithead in my liv
 ing room/ playing Resident Evil\,” it’s abundantly clear there is no r
 oommate\, that the evil resides within.  Caveman Wakes Up showcases Friend
 ship’s particular genius for visionary arrangement\, indebted equally ac
 ross generations to to the folk-rock canon of Neil Young\, Joni Mitchell\,
  and Emmylou Harris\, to Indie stalwarts like Yo La Tengo and Merge labelm
 ates Lambchop\, to contemporaries like Lomelda and ML Buch. Several of the
  songs employ fade-outs\, jokingly referred to in the lyrics of “Love Va
 pe\,” and there are other elements lifted from Motown and 70s ballads: l
 ocked-in drum patterns\, bass intervals\, sentimental string arrangements.
  Each reference is pushed past genre\, swirling and repeating\, into somet
 hing new and squarely belonging to the Friendship sound. On “Free Associ
 ation\,” “Artex\,” and “Wildwood in January\,” the groove is est
 ablished so that other sounds can come and go seamlessly\; mellotron patch
 es\, piano flurries and stabs\, and clean guitar melodies\, teeming textur
 es disguised in unity. As a work of music production\, Caveman Wakes Up is
  Friendship’s most advanced work yet\, another testament to the band’s
  devotion and care.  A droning chord calms nerves. A surreal poem moves us
  not because it’s familiar\, but because it grows\, stirs up the stagnan
 t waters. A sizzle in the brain stem. Negative capability. Caveman Wakes U
 p is dreamy\, luscious new growth for a band that has become an increasing
 ly verdant oasis in the crescent of indie country civilization. Sure to ex
 cite and mystify\, to continue growing\, to cause new life.

  ROSE CITY BAND with support TBA  $18 ADV / $22 DOS 7PM DOORS / 8PM MUSIC 
 ALL AGES  for fans of... Wooden Shjips\, MJ Lenderman\, Grateful Dead  BIO
 : Rose City Band’s country psychedelic rock evokes the wide-open spaces 
 of the American west and free spirits who call it home. The project of acc
 laimed guitarist and vocalist Ripley Johnson\, Rose City Band has extended
  beyond the studio and lives in tandem as a live ensemble featuring some o
 f the finest players in contemporary rock: pedal steel guitarist Barry Wal
 ker\, keyboardist Paul Hasenberg\, bassist Dewey Mahood (aka Plankton Wat)
  and drummer Dustin Dybvig. Garden Party is a celebration of summer and al
 l it brings: communal gatherings\, the respites offered by nature\, and an
  appreciation for even the simplest beauty\, from 12-foot sunflowers to a 
 contorted carrot planted in the spring. Freedom\, contentment\, and joy we
 re the sources for the songs. From the soaring guitar solos\, to the drivi
 ng rhythms\, the elegant pedal steel lines to the organ grooves\, Garden P
 arty has a live band’s energy captured in exquisite detail.  At its ince
 ption Rose City Band focused on what songwriter Johnson calls “porch mus
 ic”. Recorded largely at Center for Sound\, Light\, and Color Therapy in
  Portland and mixed by John McEntire\, Garden Party features guest appeara
 nces by Moon Duo bandmates John Jeffrey on drums and Sanae Yamada on synth
 s\, as well as Rose City Band live performers Hasenberg on keyboards and W
 alker on pedal steel. With the musicians in his life in mind\, Ripley’s 
 porch has opened up for each player to step into. Despite being tracked pr
 imarily as a solo endeavor the recordings capture the twists and bends of 
 a fully realized ensemble\, and in a nod to bands such as the Grateful Dea
 d it doesn’t stop there. “The songs won’t really be finished until w
 e play them on the road\,” says Johnson.  Garden Party’s carefree atti
 tude is layered with subtle turns and melodic gems which push the easygoin
 g spirit towards transcendence. The interplay of Johnson and Walker’s gu
 itars is nothing short of radiant. Opening track “Chasing Rainbows” fi
 nds the two casting out lines back and forth\, carefully weaving around an
 d through one another before basking into a wash of texture and twang. “
 Slow Burn” drives Johnson’s signature cosmic sound into the roots of t
 he earth\, twisting more grounded phrases and homespun bends around the ro
 llicking rhythm section. Walker’s range as a pedal steel player is on fu
 ll display throughout with classic licks dancing in tandem with Johnson’
 s voice. Album centerpiece “Porch Boogie” was written with the live en
 semble in mind while Johnson was out on one of his regular walks\, with on
 ly rhythmic ideas setting the pace for an extended groove that the group c
 ould stretch and relax into. The shifts in tone and feel on “Mariposa”
  and “Moonlight Highway”’s transition into “El Rio” are indicati
 ve of the expansive and unexpected directions Rose City Band are able to r
 oam as the players follow one another from tender ballads to folk rambles 
 to loping riffs. The sizzle of “Moonlight Highway” translates the unpr
 edictable and invigorating energy of the band’s road gigs into a song ta
 ilor made for dancing\, speckled with the gleaming starlight of night driv
 es across the country.  Like all great music\, Garden Party taps into the 
 listener’s emotional center and takes them to their happy place – thei
 r sunny spot. The album is an invitation to recalibrate\, a joyous ride wh
 ere the band’s sounds surround and embrace you. Ripley says it best: “
 I always like when an album starts in one place\, and ends in another” W
 hat a beautiful journey it is.

 T with support from LIP CRITIC PAT AND THE PISSERS  $16 ADV / $18 DOS 7PM 
 DOORS / 8PM MUSIC ALL AGES  for fans of... Militarie Gun\, Drug Church\, S
 nõõper  BIO: It’s exceedingly rare to hear something truly original. S
 omething that’s actually breaking new ground\, something that maybe we d
 on’t even have words for just yet. Something like MSPAINT. In a time whe
 n so much musical territory feels well-trodden\, MSPAINT are the exception
 . On their debut full-length Post-American\, the Hattiesburg\, Mississippi
 -based four-piece draw on everything from hardcore\, to hip hop\, to synth
 -punk\, and beyond to make an unabashedly weird amalgam that sounds as fre
 sh and compelling as it is instantly satisfying.  MSPAINT formed in Hattie
 sburg’s close-knit DIY music scene and are very much the sum of their pa
 rts. Made up of Randy Riley on bass\, Nick Panella on synths\, Quinn Macke
 y on drums\, and mononymous vocalist Deedee\, the pointedly guitarless ban
 d pull from each member’s individual tastes to make songs that grab you 
 by the head and don’t let go. “We’re sort of equal parts uncompromis
 ing and collaborative\,” Deedee explains. “Everyone’s musical aspira
 tions are on each track in different ways. When we started\, we knew there
  was something about it where there was no template\, but we really believ
 ed in the songs and knew we needed to push it.”  This Hattiesburg scene 
 brought the group together and also fostered their uniqueness. “Everythi
 ng in the south and in Mississippi moves a little slower\,” says Riley. 
 “Sometimes we’re the last to get things. ike certain trends\, or fundi
 ng\, or progressive ideas…a lot of time these things get to us later or 
 not at all. But it also makes it so places like Hattiesburg are a little m
 ore self-contained and people can do whatever they want. They’re not aff
 ected by trends or what’s popular. It makes things very singular and coo
 l.” In 2020\, MSPAINT hit the ground running with a self-titled debut EP
  (first released on Earth Girl Records\, and then later re-released on Con
 vulse Records)\, and soon found themselves becoming one of the pillars of 
 the Hattiesburg punk scene. “There’s always been a music community her
 e but recently a lot more people have been moving here and starting bands\
 ,” says Riley. “A lot of our friends are putting in work to make space
 s and to get the DIY punk circuit interested in coming there. It’s just 
 becoming an environment where people are getting excited about being in ba
 nds and going to shows.” Deedee adds\, “It’s definitely a bit of a s
 tate of mind. I think there’s just a lot of real artists right now who w
 ant to do their thing and that happens to be the mindset of our community.
 ”  But the group was also surprised to find their music was starting to 
 resonate with listeners outside of Hattiesburg as well–and one of those 
 new listeners was Militarie Gun/Regional Justice Center mastermind\, Ian S
 helton. Shelton was instantly struck by MSPAINT’s extraordinary sound an
 d energy\, and soon got in touch about producing the band’s debut full-l
 ength alongside engineer Taylor Young (God’s Hate\, Drain\, Full of Hell
 ). “When I first heard ‘Hardwired’ it felt like I was let in on a se
 cret\, like an undiscovered hit\,” Shelton says. “I immediately wanted
  to do everything I could to try and spread the word about them.” After 
 writing together with Shelton in Hattiesburg\, the group decamped to The P
 it Recording Studio in Los Angeles and began to record what would become P
 ost-American. Shelton adds\, “They’re a band of tinkerers\, they will 
 sit and re-work a song until you don’t recognize it anymore–I tried to
  get them to not look past their initial intuitions and just allow some th
 ings to be direct.”  Post-American delivers on the promise of MSPAINT’
 s early recordings while also taking a massive leap forward in every way. 
 The album is 30 minutes of indefinable musical current that’s delivered 
 with such passion and intensity that you can’t help but take notice\, ev
 en while you’re trying to figure out what it is you’re listening to. T
 hroughout the record\, Riley’s hyper-aggressive bass lines collide with 
 Panella’s vibrant synths\, all while Mackey’s nimble drumming manages 
 to be pummeling and groove-laden all at once.  The band’s uncommon instr
 umentals could only be matched by an equally singular vocalist\, and Deede
 e’s distinct style bridges the gap between the bite of hardcore and the 
 hooky cadences of hip hop. It’s a delivery that perfectly compliments th
 e lyrics by conveying razor sharp ideas with a viscerally satisfying attac
 k. “Sometimes with aggressive music I feel like the content can sort of 
 fall flat or be too veiled\,” Deedee explains. “It’s like you’re p
 utting your whole chest into this vocal delivery but you’re not saying s
 hit. I just really wanted to bring it all together–to say it like it’s
  the last breath you have\, but for the stuff you’re talking about to so
 und like you’re gonna live forever.” Throughout Post-American\, explor
 ations of the self deftly intersect with a drive to overcome the absurditi
 es and indignities of modern life. This is music that allows for aggressio
 n and love and frustration and beauty to all exist on the same plain\, for
  the emotional and the intellectual to feel completely seamless. “I want
 ed to completely open up on every track\, to be as vulnerable as possible\
 , but also to have a hopefulness that comes from diving deep\,” Deedee s
 ays. “Every song is coming from a place of wanting to critique but also 
 uplift.”  Tracks like the blistering “Acid” or the churning title tr
 ack evoke apocalyptic imagery\, while “Information” or “Hardwired”
  grapple with technological overload and the need for a more human connect
 ion. That connection feels achieved on “Delete It” which features Shel
 ton’s distinctive melodic roar on guest vocals. On “Decapitated Realit
 y” Deedee is joined by Soul Glo vocalist Pierce Jordan for a caustic thr
 ee minute snapshot of America’s festering anger and negativity\, but els
 ewhere the driving kineticism of “Think It Through” and towering album
  standout “Titan of Hope” are bursting with a sense of unvarnished hop
 e that comes from striving to be your truest self in face of an increasing
 ly harsh world. “It’s about exploring aspects of yourself that are the
  most fearful parts\, and bringing those things out whenever you can\,” 
 Deedee explains. “Those can be the hardest things to talk about but we n
 eed to be able to get to that kind of place. To want to be a new person be
 cause you choose to be\, not because you’re being forced to.”  Post-Am
 erican ends with “Flowers From Concrete\,” a tremendous clash of post-
 punk atmosphere filtered through noise-rock chaos. As Deedee bellows the f
 inal chorus\, the track melts into a warped\, out of focus respite before 
 abruptly kicking back into its explosive conclusion. It’s a striking bit
  of calm that accentuates the unbridled energy coursing through so much of
  MSPAINT’s music\, like a fleeting but powerful moment of clarity that y
 ou can’t quite put words to. This is music so striking and exciting that
  it will move you before you even know how to describe it.

 of all time  Dr. Melanie L. Good - Pitt Professor "Physics and Science Fic
 tion" Words like "force\," "field\," "radiation\," "black hole" and "antim
 atter" are part of our culture\; science fiction movies and popular scienc
 e magazines use them all the time. What do these words really mean? How mu
 ch of what we see in science fiction is based on real science and how much
  is pure fantasy? This course will emphasize the meanings of science terms
  and the way scientists really work\, without getting bogged down in mathe
 matics. Our goal will be to understand science terms and claims when we en
 counter them in fiction and the popular press. Along the way\, we will dis
 cuss whether travel to other stars is possible\, conditions for the existe
 nce of life\, and whether other "dimensions" exist.  And open Q&As with bo
 th after!  PLUS! 100% of the ticket sales from this event will be donated 
 back to the speakers research departments to help support their ongoing wo

 SIC ALL AGES  BIO: Mal Blum returns with new LP\, The Villain\, out via Ge
 t Better Records -- a striking resurgence that combines the artist’s tra
 demark blend of searing and wry lyricism with novel boldness and slight ca
 mp amongst a backdrop of textured indie rock\, alt-rock and pop instrument
 ation. The album is ultimately a work about human complexity and the stori
 es we tell ourselves versus the stories we are told about ourselves. There
  is no one villain. Sometimes the villain is an unreliable narrator\, some
 times a misunderstood character\, sometimes a heel-turn performance of vil
 lainy. Perhaps most notably\, given the historical and rapidly mounting de
 monization of trans people as villainous bogeymen (attitudes explored on t
 racks like “Killer” and “A Small Request”)\, often the villain app
 ears to be a purposeful construct that never truly existed at all. The lis
 tener is left not with easy answers\, but invitations. Welcome to your Vil
 lain era

   Why'd We Book It? We don't do a ton of improv here at Bottlerocket - no 
 real reason for that\, it just doesn't come across our desk very often I g
 uess. One of the improv shows we HAVE hosted though\, and one of the best 
 shows we've ever had in any genre\, is UCB's Big Grande performing for 2 s
 pecial nights in our first year open. So when Ryan from Big Grande hit us 
 up about a very special 2 man show he was looking at bringing to town with
  UCB's former artistic director Ronnie Adrian\, we jumped on it!  Bad impr
 ov is a tough sit\, I get it. We've all been to that one friends class sho
 w. But good improv? Man\, there's nothing like it. It's a highwire act of 
 laughter that you can't take your eyes off of- and you'd be hard to find 2
  guys better at it\, or doing it longer\, than Ryan and Ronnie.   Seating/

 \nFor 55 years\, Tower of Power has delivered the best in funk and soul mu
 sic.“We were a Soul band called The Motowns.” recalls Emilio Castillo.
  “Rocco was the bass player\, I was there\, and my brother was the drumm
 er. I met “Doc” Kupka back in 1968\, and gave him an audition. He came
  in the band\, and we eventually changed our name to the Tower of Power.
 ” The reason for the band name change was that they had a specific goal 
 in mind.\nEast Bay Grease defined their sound and landed them with Warner 
 Brothers. Bump City\, their 1972 debut for the label\, was a hit on both t
 he Billboard 200 and the R&B Albums chart\, and netted them the hits “Yo
 u’re Still A Young Man” and “Down to The Nightclub.” The 70s were 
 a boom period with radio classics like “So Very Hard to Go” and “Wha
 t Is Hip?\,” and the band continued to tour and record over the years. C
 astillo says their love of the stage is the same today as it was back in 1
 968.\n\n50 years later\, in 2018\, they returned to Oakland to celebrate t
 heir landmark 50th anniversary. Tower’s window-rattling grooves and rauc
 ous party spirit has been a balm for the soul throughout their half-centur
 y existence\, but the release of 50 Years of Funk & Soul: Live at the Fox 
 Theater couldn’t have arrived at a better time.\n\nThe band has long sin
 ce surpassed Castillo’s modest aspirations\, traveling the world\, enjoy
 ing hit singles on their own and backing legendary artists including Otis 
 Redding\, Elton John\, Santana\, the Grateful Dead\, John Lee Hooker\, Aer
 osmith\, Bonnie Raitt\, and countless others. In the process they’ve def
 ined an “Oakland soul” sound as instantly recognizable as those from C
 astillo’s hometown\, Detroit\, as well as inspirations like Memphis and 
 Philadelphia.\nThe future of Tower of Power is set out to be vigorous and 
 dynamic\, and will prove to be just that for fans around the world starved
  for the band’s groove just the way Tower of Power likes it!

 et: City of Asylum’s first seeds were planted back in 1997 when one man 
 came to Pittsburgh to share his story with our community. The power of tel
 ling just one story led to 21 years (and counting) of protecting freedom o
 f creative expression\, offering sanctuary to exiled writers\, and bringin
 g free arts programming to the neighborhood and beyond. Since 2022\, Stor
 y Club Pittsburgh (created by the former producers of The Moth Pittsburgh)

 perspectives\, and experiences. A charming mix of open mic nights and live
  theater\, Story Club selects a theme each month and welcomes volunteer an
 d spotlight storytellers to the stage. This June\, bring your tales of fr
 iends to lovers\, golden retriever and black cat friendships\, and shockin
 gly supportive grandparents learning about your alternative lifestyle—th
 e theme is Unlikely Allies. How to Participate:Anyone who attends Story S
 lam can sign up for a chance to share their story! Need a confidence boost
  but still want to share? The Spotlight Storyteller is an opportunity with
 in Story Club Pittsburgh to workshop your story with a coach\, build your

 Stories are pitched through submitted written drafts\, and two Spotlight S

 t better way to celebrate a new year of life than with a new book and a ne
 w series? This year\, City of Asylum honors its roots as a writer sanctuar
 y with our new “Writer-in-Residence” series\, spotlighting the talente
 d artists we host in our residency and the incredible work they produce. T
 he series begins with the distinct energy of celebration\, on the birthday
  of Writer-in-Residence Oleksandr Frazé-Frazénko\, with the launch of hi
 s new novel Nothing is Under Control. A writer without a country. A city 
 with no off switch. A memory that keeps looping back at the worst possible
  time. Nothing Is Under Control spans warzones\, subway tunnels\, half-rem
 embered childhoods\, and half-finished conversations\, as the narrator sea
 rches for meaning—or at least something that feels like it.Told in sharp
 \, poetic fragments and moments of dark humor\, this book is for anyone wh
 o’s ever felt lost in translation—between languages\, places\, or vers
 ions of themselves. Nothing Is Under Control is about exile\, identity\, a
 nd the absurd clarity that comes when everything falls apart.City of Asylu
 m’s early days began with a program much like this\, during the residenc
 y of Horacio Castellanos-Moya from 2006 to 2011. When Horacio’s novel\, 
 Senselessness\, was translated into English\, City of Asylum hosted a boo
 k launch that was so popular\, it lasted two nights. Sharing new work with
  the community\, particularly the work of international artists\, will alw
 ays be one of our core values\, and we can’t wait to continue that tradi
 tion with Nothing is Under Control.Purchase a copy of Oleksandr’s book\,

 leksandr Frazé-Frazénko is a filmmaker\, writer\, and musician. His oeuv
 re includes films\, music videos\, commercials\, a discography of over 50 
 albums\, and a dozen books of poetry. This collection includes Oleksandr
 ’s poetry volume FAQ Ukraine (2024) and the novel Nothing is Under Contr
 ol (2025). In addition to his original works\, Oleksandr published Ukraini
 an translations of Jim Morrison’s poetry (the first of their kind). He t
 ranslated English poetry of the Restoration Period\, including the works o
 f John Rochester. His photographs\, paintings\, drawings\, and sculptures 
 have been featured in private collections across the globe\, including exh
 ibitions in Ukraine\, Germany\, Canada\, and the US\, among others. During
  the first year of the war in Ukraine\, Oleksandr stayed in the country an
 d became involved in a volunteer movement working with foreign journalists
  as a producer\, filmmaker\, and writer to spread the truth about the situ
 ation and the historical context. He has been in residence as part of City

 m the award-winning author of 2007’s The Slave Ship\, we celebrate the b
 ook launch of Marcus Rediker’s latest work: Freedom Ship: The Uncharted 
 History of Escaping Slavery by Sea. Freedom Ship is a definitive\, sweepin
 g account of the Underground Railroad’s long-overlooked maritime origins
 \, deftly navigated by Marcus Rediker\, a pre-eminent scholar of Atlantic 
 history and professor at the University of Pittsburgh. In this enlightenin
 g book launch event\, Marcus will be joined in conversation by moderator T
 ony Norman\, an award-winning columnist and feature writer.Described as 
 “A triumph of storytelling as well as of archival recovery\,” by Amita
 v Ghosh (author of Sea of Poppies)\, Freedom Ship offers a groundbreaking 
 new look into the secret world of stowaways and the vessels that carried t
 hem to freedom across the North and into Canada.As many as 100\,000 enslav
 ed people fled successfully from the horrors of bondage in the antebellum 
 South\, finding safe harbor along a network of passageways across North Am
 erica now known as the Underground Railroad. The truth often untold? Many 
 of these harrowing escape journeys took place not by land but by sea. Deep
 ly researched and grippingly told\, Freedom Ship sprawls through the intri
 cate riverways of the Carolinas\, to the banks of the Chesapeake Bay\, to 
 Boston’s harbors\, illuminating the little-known stories of freedom seek
 ers who turned their sights to the sea—among them the legendary abolitio
 nist Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman\, one of the Underground Railro
 ad’s most famous architects.Marcus Rediker puts his command of archival 
 research on full display in this luminous portrait of the Atlantic waterfr
 ont as a place of conspiracy\, mutiny\, and liberation. Freedom Ship is es
 sential reading for anyone looking to understand the complete story of one
  of North America’s most significant historical moments.Purchase a copy

 nSatsang was founded by Montana-based musician Drew McManus in 2014. Known
  for their\nheartfelt\, genre-blending sound\, Satsang merges elements of 
 folk\, hip-hop\, reggae\, and\nrock\, infusing each song with introspectiv
 e lyrics and a strong message of positivity\,\nspirituality\, and social a
 wareness. The name "Satsang" reflects the band's mission\, derived\nfrom t
 he Sanskrit words for "truth" (sat) and "company" (sang)\, symbolizing gat
 herings\naimed at seeking and sharing deeper truths.\n\nThe band's music o
 ften draws from McManus's own journey of self-discovery\, healing\, and\nc
 onnection to nature\, as well as his experiences with addiction and recove
 ry. With soulful\nvocals\, acoustic melodies\, and rhythmic versatility\, 
 Satsang creates a powerful\natmosphere in both their recordings and live p
 erformances. They have built a dedicated\nfollowing through their relatabl
 e messages about love\, unity\, and resilience\, as well as their\nactive 
 support for social and environmental causes.\n\nOver the years\, Satsang h
 as released several albums\, each resonating with themes of\nhope\, intros
 pection\, and community. Their live shows are particularly celebrated for\
 ncreating a space that feels like a “satsang”—a gathering for connec
 tion and upliftment—\nwhere fans can come together to share in a collect
 ive experience of music\, inspiration\, and\ntruth-seeking.\nThis Event Is

 ALE -- Friday\, May 16 @ 10am\n\nYuno’s full-length debut\, Blest\, out 
 May 16 on Sub Pop\, finds the enigmatic indie-pop visionary transforming t
 he emo-tinged suburban malaise of his 2018 Moodie EP into more expansive\,
  widescreen pop drama — suited for big moves and bigger stages. The kale
 idoscopic sound he devised as a millennial hermit in his childhood bedroom
  in Florida has since broadened his horizons\, taking him on tour with Unk
 nown Mortal Orchestra and Superorganism\, and soundtracking various series
  for Netflix and HBO. Imbued with elements of dream-pop\, rock\, trap\, an
 d psychedelia\, his eclectic songs serve as bids for love and connection\,
  which especially in the fractured era of social media\, have resonated wi
 th many listeners who find solace in his vulnerability.\n\nThis Event Is A

DESCRIPTION:https://mrsmalls.com/events/the-dangerous-summer-2/\nThe Danger
 ous Summer signed their first record deal as high school seniors and quick
 ly established themselves among the alt-rock world’s elite. Passionate d
 elivery\, confessional authenticity\, and deeply resonant musical storytel
 ling define their sound. The band writes hooks that serve as soundtracks f
 or important life moments for a diverse group of listeners spread across t
 he globe. The audience is more family than a fanbase. The community feelin
 g is apparent at every gig\, from Slam Dunk to Riot Fest\, from touring wi
 th State Champs to headlining shows. Reach for the Sun is the record that 
 “shot them into the pop-punk pantheon” (Kerrang!). Powered by unshakea
 ble\, enduring alt-rock anthems\, the Ellicott City\, Maryland band’s de
 but album made them heroes of the Warped Tour world\, all while they carve
 d their own unique path. 2011’s War Paint was a sophomore-slump-smashing
  follow-up. Grantland likened the “tall and wide” riffs of 2013’s Go
 lden Record to The Hold Steady and U2. (“Catholic Girls” even earned T
 he Danger Summer praise from the famously discerning Pitchfork.) Alternati
 ve Press saluted The Dangerous Summer as a group that stayed true to their
  sound\, praising the songs on their 2018 self-titled comeback album as eq
 ual parts charismatic and addictive. 2019’s Mother Nature conjured an em
 otional storm\, with an uplifting bent. Underoath’s Aaron Gillespie appe
 ared on the 2020 EP\, All That Is Left Of The Blue Sky. Produced by Will B
 easley (Turnstile\, Asking Alexandria)\, 2022’s Coming Home ushers in a 
 new era for TDS. The Dangerous Summer never sacrificed their unique\, dive
 rse sonic identity\, one that appeals to fans of everything from Kings Of 
 Leon and Coldplay to Jimmy Eat World and Bright Eyes. Coming Home is a tri
 umphant summary of what The Dangerous Summer is all about\, past\, present
 \, and future.\n\nThis Event Is All Ages

 -crash-nebula/\nUp-and-coming Milwaukee band Lake Drive graced X-Ray Arcad
 e in the Milwaukee area for the “Post-Internet Romance” EP Release Sho
 w on Oct. 11 with support from Superglue\, Micah Emrich\, and The Keystone
 s. \nThe group dropped their first single\, “Dance Until We’re Dead\,
 ” last April\, and has dominated the Milwaukee scene ever since. They op
 ened for Blame My Youth at The Rave / Eagles Club this spring\, played Sum
 merfest in the summer\, and are on their first fall tour in the Midwest. A
 long with their continued growth this year\, “Best Part\,” from their 
 new EP “Post-Internet Romance\,” is featured in Apple Music’s “New
  in Rock” playlist. \nLake Drive has the over-the-top glamour of The 197
 5 with the distinct riffs and lyricism of Midwest emo indie rock. Their se
 t was the perfect meld of 80’s pop rock\, sensuality\, self-depreciation
 \, and emotion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontman Rayven Burdette took the X-Ray Arca
 de stage with a bouquet of red roses before throwing them to the eager cro
 wd for EP track “ur so funny.” The band had undeniable chemistry\, int
 eracting heavily with each other and their already-cult fanbase. \n“You 
 guys are the biggest f—ing crowd we’ve ever played for\,” Burdette s
 aid\, expressing his gratitude. “We’ve never had a crowd this big in o
 ur hometown. We love you so much.” \nGuitarist Brandon Detaege sported a
  cropped Milwaukee Bucks shirt– showing love to the city. \nCrowd partic
 ipation persisted with headbanging and chanting for singles “Overrated
 ” and “Plus One.” All the while\, red heart-shaped balloons bounced 
 atop the engaged audience. \n“The boys and I were talking before\,” Bu
 rdette said in segway to “Best Part.” “All of you guys are the best 
 part of what we do. We love you so much.” \nThe feeling was undeniably m
 utual. The band left the stage\, having performed all 6 songs off of their
  EP. Fans needed more\, chanting for Lake Drive to play one more song. \n\
 n\n\n\n\n\n“Sorry you guys\, we can’t play one more song\,” Burdette
  responded. “We’re going to play two more songs. They haven’t even b
 een recorded yet. We want to test them out… Are you guys ready? Let’s 
 f—ing dance.” \nAfter playing the new\, unreleased song\, Burdette ask
 ed what the audience thought of the song\, one out of ten. \n“Ten\, ten\
 , ten\,” the crowd chanted in response. \nLake Drive topped off the nigh
 t with a stunning cover of “Robbers” by The 1975\, confirming the insp
 iration in sound and energy. Burdette’s vocals were flawless and capture
 d the vulnerable sensation of the original version while adding a unique t
 wist. Once this cover is released on streaming and promoted on social medi
 a\, it may be the kicker to a booming career for these guys. \nWith unmatc
 hed confidence\, showstopping performance\, and exceptional delivery\, Lak
 e Drive proved to be a band to watch \n\n\n\n\n\nLinks for Lake Drive:\nWe

 oors @ 7pm Show @ 8pmAGE RESTRICTION: 18+ or with Legal GuardianThe Fear 
 of Standing Still is a record about growing up and growing older. I am not
  the wild partying 21 year old rock n roll front man that I used to be. I
 ’m a husband. I’m a father. I’ve been sober for a decade now. It’s
  a record that proves you don’t have to always be going 100mph to find s
 uccess in this business. It’s a record that says “it’s ok to take a 
 minute to reflect on how far you’ve come\, not worry about how much furt
 her you have to go”.\n \nFor the longest time I thought that if I took 
 my foot off the gas for even a second\, I would lose all the ground that I
  had gained. Fatherhood changed that. I’ve found a really beautiful bala
 nce between rock n roll and family\, and I wanted a record that showcased 
 that freedom. In the studio\, I’ve always strived to find the perfect ba
 lance between showcasing the songwriting and the fact that I have a really
  great rock n roll band. This record is the closest we’ve ever come to t
 hat intersection. These songs are big\, anthemic rock songs but also stand
  on their own two feet when they are played on an acoustic guitar. We have
  always taken a lot of pride in that fact.\n \nThematically\, I cover a l
 ot of ground on this record: nostalgia\, death\, regional identity\, marri
 age\, fatherhood\, redemption\, mental health. My records have always been
  a snapshot of the person I was when I wrote it and this record really fin
 ds the band and my songwriting both really hitting a stride. I feel extrem

 STENTexas blues-rock singer/songwriter and guitarist extraordinaire\, Ally
  Venable\, entertains wherever she goes. With her signature glitter dresse
 s and black knee-high boots\, Venable comes off of the ropes swinging dazz
 ling crowds on tour or throughout the festival circuit. “Venable pulls o
 ff a stunner of gritty and/or sultry blues rock tunes embellished with lot
 s of tasty guitar solos.” – Guitar Player Magazine. A Kilgore\, Texas 
 native\, Ally began singing at church at four and picked up the guitar at 
 age 12. By 13\, she started her own band and through her early influence o
 f Stevie Ray Vaughan captured the passion and yearning for more in the blu
 es genre. Early releases No Glass Shoes (2016) and Puppet Show (2018) star
 ted her fanbase\, charting radio play\, and several East Texas Music Award
 s. It was 2019’s #2 Billboard Blues charting Texas Honey and rocking set
 s on Ruf’s European Blues Caravan tour that propelled her internationall
 y. “Ally is the future of blues and the crossover music of American root
 s-rock.” – Mike Zito. In what silenced many musicians during the pande
 mic\, Venable now in her 20’s\, released another Blues Billboard chartin
 g album\, Heart of Fire (2021)\, which challenged her to write not only ab
 out love but the unguarded honesty of feeling pain.”On this album\,I rea
 lly wanted to create a tone of overcoming your struggles and persevering t
 hrough them\,” she explains. Mentor and featured artist on this album\, 
 Kenny Wayne Shepherd\, lends his guitar skills on XM Bluesville’s charte
 d song\, “Bring on the Pain.” In 2022\, Guitar World Magazine named Al
 ly #2 on the top 15  Young Guns Making the Gibson Les Paul Cool Again\, a
 nd she received the Road Warrior award from the Independent Blues Music Aw
 ards.  Along with Ally’s own tour domestically and in Europe\, her band
  has supported Buddy Guy and Kenny Wayne Shepherd throughout the US\, as w
 ell as Colin James in Canada. She has performed as a featured artist on th
 e Experience Hendrix Show at the ACL Live at Moody Theater in Austin\, Tex
 as. Fans are anticipating Venable’s upcoming spring 2023 release produce
 d by Grammy award winning producer\, Tom Hambridge\, which includes a duet
  with the iconic Buddy Guy and a song featuring powerhouse guitarists Joe 
 Bonamassa.\n \n*This is a general admission event. There is plenty of sea

 Newcastle’s Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs hardly imagined they’d 
 make it all the way to album number five. For a while\, it looked as thoug
 h they wouldn’t make it out of the pub. Since that debut did come out\, 
 the psychedelic metal outfit have been on an extraordinary roll. 2017’s 
 three-song monsterpiece Feed The Rats was followed promptly by the next ye
 ar’s rollicking King Of Cowards. A smorgasbord of heavy styles\, Viscera
 ls maintained the momentum\, in spite of its coinciding with the 2020 lock
 down. Back on the road for 2023’s Land Of Sleeper\, Pigs saw their audie
 nce grow and grow\, with the territories they’re able to play expanding 
 likewise. \nWhereas Land Of Sleeper was conceived as an immersive headpho
 nes experience\, this time around Pigs strove for something more directly 
 hostile with 2025’s Death Hilarious. “We wanted it to be a slap in the
  face. There’s a lot of aggro in it. It’s very angular and direct.” 
 That came\, in part\, from playing so many gigs over the last couple of ye
 ars. The band felt well-oiled and ripe to give listeners at home the kind 
 of pummelling their audiences receive.  \nDeath Hilarious is a diversely
  punishing record which shapeshifts through Sabbathian doom\, grotesquely 
 minimalist noise rock and cyclical post-metal fortissimos. Pigs continue t
 o push themselves\, too. Incongruous synthesiser solos appear where guitar
  histrionics would usually fit. Piano tracks lurk in the mix\, adding near
 -subliminal depth to the maelstrom. ‘Stitches’ is like Motörhead tryi
 ng to perform glam rock with a tipsy keyboardist. \nDeath Hilarious: two 
 singularly evocative words that don’t obviously belong together. This si
 gnifies the gravity of life as well as its inherent and undeniable absurdi
 ty. Pigs have always toyed with contradictions and juxtapositions in their
  art\, so the title fits perfectly. They play dark\, heavy and aggressive 
 music\, and they do it in an uplifting way\, smiles beaming across their f
 aces. They are seriously and sincerely committed\, yet they remain forever
  and wisely grounded by the ridiculous band name they chose over a decade 
 ago\, possibly while more than a little half-cut\, when they really should
 ’ve been rehearsing. \n\n \nTicket Tier Info:General Admission Tickets

 sday August 7\, 2025Thunderbird Music Hall4053 Butler Street\, Pittsburgh\
 , PADoors @ 7pmShow @ 8pmAGE RESTRICTION: 18+ or with legal guardian\nEric
  D. Johnson rarely lingers at one location too long.\n“There’s always 
 been motion in my life between one place and another\,” says the Fruit 
 Bats songwriter.\nAs a kid growing up in the Midwest\, Johnson’s family
  moved around a lot\, but it wasn’t until he became a touring musician y
 ears later that motion became a central part of his identity. That transie
 nt lifestyle stoked an enduring reverence for the world he watched pass by
  through a van window.\n“It weighs heavily on me—the notion of place\,
 ” Johnson says. “The places I’ve been and the places I want to go.
 ”\nA sense of place is a unifying theme he’s revisited with Fruit Bats
  throughout its many lives. From the project’s origins in the late ’90
 s as a vehicle for Johnson’s lo-fi tinkering to the more sonically ambit
 ious work of recent years\, Fruit Bats has often showcased love songs wher
 e people and locations meld into one. It’s a loose song structure that n
 avigates what he calls “the geography of the heart.”\n“The songs exi
 st in a world that you can sort of travel from one to another\,” says Jo
 hnson. “There are roads and rivers between these songs.”\nThose pathwa
 ys extend straight through the newest Fruit Bats album\, aptly titled A R
 iver Running to Your Heart. Self-produced by Johnson—a first for Fruit B
 ats—with Jeremy Harris at Panoramic House just north of San Francisco\, 
 it’s Fruit Bats’ tenth full-length release. The album finds the projec
 t in the middle of a people-powered climb leading to the biggest shows\, l
 oudest accolades\, and most enthusiastic new fans in Fruit Bats history! I
 t’s hard to pinpoint a single reason for this mid-career resurgence. But
  after two decades of making music\, hard-earned emotional maturity has cl
 early seeped into Johnson’s already inviting songs\, resulting in a soun
 d that’s connected with audiences like no other previous version of the 
 band.\nA River Running to Your Heart represents the fullest realization of
  Johnson’s creative vision to date. It’s a sonically diverse effort th
 at largely explores the importance of what it means to be home\, both phys
 ically and spiritually. And while that might seem like a peculiar focus fo
 r an artist who’s constantly in motion\, for Fruit Bats\, home can take 
 many forms—from the obvious to the obscure.\n“We lost some time / But 
 we can make it back / Let’s take it easy on ourselves\, okay?” sings a
  world-weary but ultimately reassuring Johnson in the song’s opening lin
 es. It’s the kind of performance that makes you hope Fruit Bats stays in
  this one place\, at least for a little while longer.\n\n \nTicket Tier I

 oors @ 7pmShow @ 8pmAGE RESTRICTION: 18+ or with legal guardian\n \n\nGeo
 rdie’s debut solo album boasts a brand of high quality\, all-embracing a
 lternative pop fun not heard in a very long time\, walking the line betwee
 n the ridiculous and brilliant with a teflon-coated aplomb.\nHow the recor
 d came about is a thing to marvel at. Over thirty session musicians were i
 nvolved in its making\, on two continents. Greep says\, “Half of the tra
 cks were done in Brazil\, with local musicians pulled together at the last
  minute. They’d never heard anything I’d done before\, they were just 
 interested in the demos I’d made. The tracking was all done in one\, may
 be two days.”\nThe spirit of Greep’s increasingly febrile and furtive 
 soliloquies simultaneously calls to mind both Frank Zappa and Frank Sinatr
 a\, with a healthy dash of Scott Walker sprinkled throughout.The instrumen
 tal title track is a jazz-funk workout that could double as a soundtrack f
 or a TV series or the intro music for a Broadway musical. Brass\, wah-wah 
 pedal and bass stabs\, choruses and polyrhythms\, all fizz and tumble arou
 nd the place creating a sense of excitement and expectation. Tracks often 
 oscillate from whispers to shouts\, and start and end on a bang.\nThe stor
 ies themselves act as a shopping list of the Active Male Imagination. A se
 ries of vignettes\, where Geordie Greep plays the role of emcee and conduc
 tor. The characters we hear from are engaged in wild fantasies and situati
 ons in which they inevitably falter. “The main theme of the record is de
 speration\; someone who is kidding themselves that they have everything un
 der control\, but they don’t.” Here Greep gives color to a set of imag
 inings which include cannibalism\, being boiled alive\, and a woman giving
  birth to a goat.\nStreet life is all around The New Sound: the listener i
 s thrown into a world of cafes\, bars\, rented rooms\, cabarets and strang
 e museums. Here we see our heroes carry out a series of naughty assignment
 s\, military cosplay or socio-economic triumphs. The lines between parody 
 and sermon are often blurred. The urbane romantic fantasy of single ‘Hol
 y Holy’ tells the story of an imaginary liaison in a nightclub\, soundtr
 acked by ’noughties indie chords and bravura Latin big band arrangements
  – including a three-piano attack.\nWhat next?“My plan is to ‘do a K
 eith Jarrett thing’\, have a different group of session musicians in a d
 ifferent place and lean into the fact that we’re not going to get it the
  same.”\nHow can anything ever be ‘the same’ with Greep at the helm?

 oors @ 7pmShow @ 8pmAGE RESTRICTION: 18+ or with legal guardian\nFolksinge
 r Willi Carlisle holds tight the conviction that love is bigger than hate\
 , and no-one is expendable. Carlisle’s music has always been a dance bet
 ween absurdity\, spectacle\, and philosophy. On his fourth studio album\, 
 Winged Victory\, Carlisle returns with his signature blend of traditionall
 y-rooted folk music and kaleidoscope of oddball characters to confer with 
 his core tenets in more overt and provocative ways. \nCarlisle delivers Vi
 ctory as the next chapter in his long-running direct address to the hope t
 hat by understanding our collective suffering we might be free of it. He
 ’s intent on creating art and a well-rounded life in a broken world. The
  idea began with 2022’s Peculiar\, Missouri when Carlisle proclaimed “
 your heart’s a big tent\, everybody gets in.” After gathering together
  all the world’s weirdos and misfits under the big tent\, with 2024’s 
 Critterland\, Carlisle let them loose into the world. Now\, on Winged Vict
 ory\, they speak for themselves\, unencumbered by social expectations.  \
 nVictory\, Carlisle’s first self-produced album\, will be released June
  27 via Signature Sounds.  Though occasionally raunchy\, and routinely p
 rovocative\, Victory is not afraid to make a spectacle for the sake of a p
 oint. Victory should be understood as a reflection. It revels in the beaut
 y of tiny\, monetarily-worthless moments and things\, offering with them a
  consideration of our innate humanity. \n\nTicket Tier Info:General Admis

  RESTRICTION: 21+\nVirginian\, Keller Williams\, released his first album 
 in 1994\, FREEK\, and has since given each of his albums a single syllable
  title: BUZZ\, SPUN\, BREATHE\, LOOP\, LAUGH\, HOME\, DANCE\, STAGE\, GRAS
 S\, DREAM\, TWELVE\, LIVE\, ODD\, THIEF\, KIDS\, BASS\, PICK\, FUNK\, VAPE
 \, SYNC\, RAW\, SANS\, ADD\, SPEED\, CELL\, DROLL and now DEER. Each title
  serves as a concise summation of the concept guiding each project. Keller
 ’s albums reflect his pursuit to create music that sounds like nothing e
 lse. Un-beholden to conventionalism\, he seamlessly crosses genre boundari
 es. The end product is music that encompasses rock\, jazz\, funk and blueg
 rass\, and always keeps the audience on their feet. Keller built his reput
 ation initially on his engaging live performances\, no two of which are ev
 er alike. For most of his career he has performed solo. His stage shows ar
 e rooted around Keller singing his compositions and choice cover songs\, w
 hile accompanying himself on acoustic guitar\, bass\, guitar synthesizer a
 nd drum samples\; a technique called live phrase sampling or “looping”
 . The end result often leans toward a hybrid of alternative folk and groov
 y electronica\, a genre Keller jokingly calls “acoustic dance music” o
 r ADM.” Keller’s constant evolution has led to numerous band projects 
 as well\; Keller & The Keels\, Grateful Grass\, KWahtro\, Keller and the T
 ravelin’ McCourys\, Grateful Gospel\, More Than A Little and most recent
 ly DeadPettyKellerGrass. You can even catch him from time to time going ba
 ck to his troubadour roots with his “Shut the Folk Up and Listen” seri
 es.   Keller can be found playing clubs and festivals with these projects
  and his tried and true solo looping show\, always changing things up and 
 keeping moving.  \n\nTicket Tier Info:General Admission Tickets – Stan

 verse of Battle Tour – Nick ShouldersFriday\, November 21st 2025Thunder

 E RESTRICTION: 21+\nNick Shoulders – All Bad\nAll Bad\, the latest album
  from Nick Shoulders\, released via Gar Hole Records (a label founded and 
 co-owned by Shoulders)\, ultimately encapsulates everything that makes Sho
 ulders’ inimitable form of country music so vital: a heady balance of da
 zzling musicianship and punk defiance\, coupled with gritty eccentricity a
 nd a generational connection to the roots of the genre. With a singing sty
 le inherited from his family’s vocal lineage\, Nick’s songs achieve th
 e rare feat of imparting difficult truths while inciting a certain joyful 
 abandon\, balancing a sound forged by years of hard travel with a heartfel
 t reverence for the origins of country music. In the spirit of Hazel Dicke
 ns and Jimmy Driftwood\, the incisive yet wildly jubilant All Bad vocally 
 objects to the reckless destruction of the natural landscape and developme
 nt run rampant\, while still offering plenty of joy and dance-ready rhythm
 s. Spanning a variety of early country styles\, the album’s infectious h
 armonies shine alongside everything from jangling cajun waltzes to surf-ro
 ck infused bluesy ballads–all tied together by a voice seemingly out of 
 place in this century\, yet ever ready to speak up about its problems. \n
 Surrounded by a singing style passed down from a time before microphones\,
  Nick’s childhood of bird call whistles and an over-exposure to southern
  gospel music eventually steered him toward an adolescence drumming for me
 tal and punk bands\, and subsequent years as an active illustrator and mem
 ber of Arkansas’s heavy music scene. After numerous personal calamities 
 and a growing obsession with the rural musical traditions of his lifelong 
 home\, Shoulders left the Ozarks and lived out of his van\, singing on the
  street corners of the west while slowly being drawn to the vibrance of th
 e New Orleans dance and busking world. Following the release of ‘Rather 
 Low’ by the popular YouTube channel Western AF\, which catapulted Nick
 ’s songs to a vastly wider audience right as Covid-19 and lockdowns ensu
 ed\, he’s seen rapid ascension into the world of touring music\, playing
  alongside the likes of Sierra Ferrell and at major festivals such as Stag
 ecoach. With the hard rhythms and heavenly melodies of the newest release\
 , All Bad\, Shoulders manages to concoct a body of work that is at turns s
 ublimely freewheeling and profoundly illuminating\, yet primed to permanen
 tly warp the listener’s perspective to glorious effect.\n \nTicket Tier

 ether \nWe are The Altogether from Tarrytown\, NY! – an indie folk-rock 
 band featuring siblings Jonah & Sierra Scott and Emma Freeman. We have sel
 f-released a number of singles\, four EPs\, and two LPs\, with more than 2
 0 million accumulated streams on Spotify. Songs written by Jonah & Brian D
 avid Gilbert in college became the basis for our debut EP Look Up in 2018.
  Our first LP – Silo – was one of the top sellers on Bandcamp for its 
 release month\, August 2020. And our latest EP – Hazy Dawn – is a four
 -song album filled with lush vocal harmonies and arcadian summer sounds. I
 t is the first project to feature Emma as a bandmember and lead singer. Ou
 r songs span a wide breadth of styles and sounds. From the stripped back f
 olksy simplicity of ‘Newton’s First’ to the saturated maximalism of 
 ‘Nothing Will Come of It Joe. ’ A bit of bubble gum acoustic pop in 
 ‘Ladybug’ and a dose of head banging hard rock in ‘Background Noise.
 ’ Overall though\, we gravitate more toward the organic than the process
 ed\, and always let honest\, heartfelt songwriting speak for itself. Audie
 nces who enjoy real instruments being played and real voices singing genui
 ne lyrics will find a home in our music. \nWe have recently played a numbe
 r of live shows at venues including NYC’s Rockwood Music Hall\, Main Dra
 g Music\, Arlene’s Grocery\, Pianos\, and Wolf Studios. We’ve entertai
 ned crowds as far away as Amsterdam\, and as close to our backyard as Slee
 py Hollow’s Philipsburg Manor. As a folk group specializing in three-par
 t harmony\, we know that our songs are best enjoyed live! \nFollow along!

 ttsburgh\, PADoors @ 6:30pm Show @ 8pmAGE RESTRICTION: 18+ or with legal 
 guardian\nPool Kids’ third album\, Easier Said Than Done\, shimmers with
  emotional clarity and courage. Adrenalizing and irresistible\, it brings 
 the dynamism of the band’s live show into the studio\, showcasing a styl
 e that’s unmistakably their own.\nPool Kids first started playing on Tal
 lahassee’s house show circuit. The band earned a fan in Paramore’s Hay
 ley Williams with their debut album\, 2018’s Music to Practice Safe Sex 
 To. After they filled out to a four-piece — Andy Anaya on guitar\, Nicol
 ette Alvarez on bass\, Caden Clinton on drums\, and Christine Goodwyne on 
 guitar and vocals — their 2022 self-titled record netted critical acclai
 m with its lush\, high-contrast mixture of pop\, emo\, and math rock. They
 ’ve shared stages with The Mountain Goats\, PUP\, Beach Bunny\, and La D
 ispute. They hold fast to their DIY principles: Anyone can do what Pool Ki
 ds do. Anyone can start a band.\nFor Easier Said Than Done\, Pool Kids wor
 ked with producer Mike Vernon Davis (Foxing\, Great Grandpa). They funded 
 the record themselves\, and spent five weeks recording in Seattle. To save
  money during sessions\, they stayed with friends\, in motels\, and slept 
 on the floor of the studio. “We did a lot of searching\, playing each so
 ng a million different ways and deciding which one sounded the best\,” s
 ays Goodwyne. With the completed record in hand\, the band signed to Epita
 ph.\nOn the thundering “Tinted Windows\,” Goodwyne grits her teeth at 
 the way spending months on tour and missing important milestones can stres
 s close relationships. “Exit Plan” memorializes the experience of sayi
 ng goodbye to friends at the end of a string of shows\, knowing those powe
 rful bonds may never feel the same again. On “Bad Bruise\,” Goodwyne m
 akes a bid for understanding: “Pretty please\, empathy / Got me on my kn
 ees\,” she sings while the band closes ranks around her.\nPowerful colle
 ctivity rings through Easier Said Than Done — in the dynamic interplay b
 etween Goodwyne and Anaya’s guitars\, in Alvarez’s gravitational bassl
 ines\, in Clinton’s whirling drum patterns. Pool Kids lock together into
  a unified force\, propelling themselves forward into hard-won release. Ea
 sier Said Than Done impresses one of the most important reminders anyone c
 an hear: You don’t have to do anything in this world alone.\nTicket Tier

   $15 ADV / $18 DOS 7PM DOORS / 8PM MUSIC ALL AGES  for fans of... MC Lars
 \, MC Chris\, Mega Ran  MC FRONTALOT BIO: MC Frontalot (née Damian Hess) 
 is the original mastermind of Nerdcore Hip-Hop and still its Final Boss.  
 Front was born in San Francisco and grew up in Berkeley. He was tall and s
 crawny\, had trouble breathing\, and could not see well. A special teacher
  was called in to help him attain basic competence on the monkey bars\, an
 other to give him standardized tests meant for older children. Thusly\, he
  was the most popular kid in his elementary school. Just kidding! He got p
 ushed down a lot and called “nerd.” Did he maybe even deserve it? I me
 an\, really – who strikes out at kickball?   He spent the next twenty ye
 ars or so trying to get over it. And kind of succeeded! Flash forward to 1
 999: the dotcom bubble is maximally inflated\; nerds everywhere imagine th
 emselves to be popular and/or hip. Damian is getting overpaid to code web 
 pages\, which leaves him free in the evenings to play with audio software.
  A longtime idolizer of rappers\, he has been committing his own esoteric 
 hip-hop compositions to four-track tape since high school\, revealing them
  to nobody. But\, suddenly! Multi-track desktop studios\, cheap pro-grade 
 recording hardware\, skyrocketing bandwidth\, semi-anonymous web publishin
 g: these factors converge on Damian’s rap hobby like a flock of winged m
 onkeys. He posts an MC Frontalot web page\, dubbing his output “Nerdcore
  Hip-Hop” because his audience is composed of several Star Wars figurine
 s who live on his desk (and also random internet people who click on his M
 P3s by mistake).   Somehow\, it is a quarter-century later. Nerdcore has m
 etastasized into an internet phenomenon and underground touring powerhouse
 \, with dozens of well established live acts and hundreds of home-studio r
 hymers self-identifying within the subgenre. MC Frontalot\, called alterna
 tely the movement's godfather or grandfather (thanks\, kids)\, leads the c
 harge\, performing for thousands around the country and at prominent geek 
 gatherings such as Comic-Con\, DEF CON\, the Penny Arcade Expo\, Super MAG
 Fest\, and BlizzCon. He’s been featured in The New York Times\, Spin\, W
 ired\, XXL\, Newsweek\, CNN\, Blender\, XLR8R\, USA Today\, Entertainment 
 Weekly\, The London Daily Telegraph\, NPR\, G4TV\, Esquire\, Playboy\, CMJ
 \, The Guardian (UK)\, The Wall Street Journal\, and scores of city papers
  nationally and internationally. He has released seven studio albums\, Ner
 dcore Rising (Sept 2005)\, Secrets From The Future (Apr 2007)\, Final Boss
  (Nov 2008)\, Zero Day (Apr 2010)\, Solved (Aug 2011)\, Question Bedtime (
 Aug 2014)\, and Net Split\, or the Fathomless Heartbreak of Online Itself 
 (March 2019). The documentary feature\, Nerdcore Rising: The Movie\, which
  focuses on Front’s live band and exposes the the Nerdcore phenomenon in
  general\, debuted at the South By Southwest Film Festival in 2008.   Fron
 t lives in Berkeley\, CA\, and still spends most of his time rapping into 
 a computer.   SCHAFFER THE DARKLORD BIO: Schaffer the Darklord (or STD) is
  a New York City-based rapper\, drummer and comedian with material best-su
 ited for nerdy and/or hedonistic audiences. With manic energy fueling a ca
 rtoonishly commanding stage presence\, STD skewers such topics as substanc

 Y\, JUNE 13 @ 10AM!\n\nAt its best\, harmony duo singing can transform sim
 ple math into a magic trick. One plus one\, instead of equaling two\, sudd
 enly yields an unexpected third thing. An upper-case ONE. A universal hum.
  A deep vibration that encompasses two different points of view. On their 
 latest release\, Every Time I Think About You\, brothers Jack Torrey and P
 age Burkum\, aka The Cactus Blossoms\, once again prove themselves to be a
 mong the most adept – and distinctive – modern practitioners of that m
 agic. But like any great magician\, The Cactus Blossoms can’t – or won
 ’t – fully explain the illusion they create.\n\n“Harmonies are a big
  part of our sound\, but in some ways they’re the part we focus on the l
 east\,” says Burkum. “We put most of our attention and energy into the
  songs themselves and then the harmonies just happen.”\n\nThere’s all 
 kinds of magic happening on Every Time I Think About You\, a record that s
 ounds more like a band than any other in the Cactus Blossoms discography\,
  thanks to contributions from Jeremy Hanson (drums)\, Jacob Hanson (guitar
 ) and Phillip Hicks (bass). “There She Goes” casts its romantic regret
  against a danceable bop beat\, and the title track is a heart-wrencher ab
 out loss and letting go.\n\n“Even if you don’t set out to write songs 
 with a theme in mind it seems like one usually presents itself\,” says T
 orrey. “This record keeps returning to the idea of ‘moving on’ — f
 rom one place to another\, from people and situations that bring you down\
 , from loss and grief.”\n\nThis Event Is All Ages

 Super Duper Hot Dog stand and its variety of toppings and sauces. Chicago\

  program - the aptly titled A Hot Dog Program. It's a cross country road t
 rip meeting all kinds of characters and dogs along the way\, from the O in
  Pittsburgh (RIP) to the Nathans Hot Dog Eating Contest in New York - it's
  a heartwarming film about something we probably take for granted\, which

 per\, City of Asylum Curator for World LiteratureA weekend spent antiquing
  is shadowed by the colonial atrocities that occurred on that land. A walk
  at dusk is interrupted by casual racism. A loving marriage is riven by my
 sterious tensions. And a remarkable cascade of voices speaks out from a pu
 lsing metropolis.Tremor is a startling work of realism and invention that 
 engages brilliantly with literature\, music\, race\, and history as it exa
 mines the passage of time and how we mark it. It is a reckoning with human
  survival amidst “history’s own brutality\, which refuses symmetries a
 nd seldom consoles\,” but it is also a testament to the possibility of j
 oy. As he did in his magnificent debut\, Open City\, Teju Cole once again 
 offers narration with all its senses alert\, a surprising and deeply essen
 tial work from a beacon of contemporary literature.You can purchase a copy
  of Teju’s book\, Tremor\, at City of Asylum Bookstore.About the Author:

 nWe welcome the joyful return of fan-favorite Hugo Cruz for the first of a
  three-part concert series titled “The Voice of the Drums.” This perfo
 rmance will feature Hugo Cruz and Pittsburgh jazz icon Roger Humphries as 
 they create a musical dialogue between Cuban and Pittsburgh traditions on 
 one of the world’s oldest instruments—the drums. About the Artists:Hu
 go Alexander Cruz Machado is a Cuban-born\, award-winning drummer and comp
 oser who has performed internationally\, including South Korea\, Spain\, S
 weden\, Mexico\, Chile\, Venezuela\, and the United States. Hugo is the le

 his early talent for playing drums. He began playing professionally at fou
 rteen\, and within two years\, he was leading his own group at Carnegie Mu
 sic Hall. In 1964\, Roger went to New York to join the Horace Silver Quint
 et. While with Silver\, Roger recorded three albums: Song For My Father\, 
 Cape Verdean Blues\, and Jody Grind\, with Song for My Father taking its p
 lace as one of the most legendary albums of our time. Roger is rated by mu

  has provided the rhythmic beat for such greats as Ray Charles\, Horace Si
 lver\, Richard “Groove” Holmes\, Stanley Turrentine\, James Moody\, Le
 e Morgan\, Dr. Billy Taylor\, Benny Green\, Lionel Hampton\, Coleman Hawki
 ns\, Clark Terry\, J.J. Johnson\, Dizzy Gillespie\, and countless others.

 career as a sideman\, most notably with the flautist Herbie Mann. In the e
 arly 1970s\, he formed his band Ubiquity. Along with scoring films\, Roy w
 ould go on to create his unique jazz/R&B/funk sound\, which would spawn th
 e iconic classics “Mystic Voyage” and “Everybody Loves the Sunshine\
 ,” among others.The Roy Ayers Tribute Band will feature veteran Pittsbur
 gh vibraphonist Tubby Daniels\, along with Pittsburgh smooth jazz and R&B 
 bassist John Hall as musical director. Filling out the bill are Cleveland

 oors @ 7pmShow @ 8pmAGE RESTRICTION: 18+ or with legal guardian\nAfter a m
 eteoric rise from obscurity to a national touring band\, Los Angeles-based
  Grateful Shred has made the most of its time in the spotlight. The lineup
 \, featuring Dan Horne and Austin McCutchen alongside keyboardist Adam Mac
 Dougall woke the Grateful Dead cosmos with a unique laid-back harmony driv
 en sound. The band literally went from playing the Shakedown Street vendor
  area prior to Dead and Company shows to touring the United States.\nThe m
 oment that sent the band’s popularity soaring is the “Busted at the Bo
 wl” video\, a YouTube video that features Shred members starting an impr
 omptu set in the parking lot of the Hollywood Bowl before a Dead and Compa
 ny show in 2017. They don’t get too far before drawing so much attention
  that the police shut them down. Instantly creating Shred-cred\, this was 
 a bit of good fortune that doesn’t get past McCutchen. “We’ve been d
 ealt some pretty good cards\,” he states. “It’s been cool to roll wi
 th it and push forward and continually make stuff happen. Things have gone
  our way. Even that video happened magically. It was put together at the l
 ast minute\, and boom!”\nThe thing is\, Grateful Shred manage to channel
  that elusive Dead vibe: wide-open guitar tones\, effortless three-part vo
 cal harmonies\, choogling beats\, and yes\, plenty of tripped out\, Shredd
 ed solos. The look\, the sound\, the atmosphere. It’s uncanny. Far from 
 being a historical re-enactment\, Grateful Shred’s laissez faire vibe in
 fuses the band with a gentle spirit\, warmth\, and (dare we say it) authen
 ticity. From their killer merch game to their eminently watchable YouTube 
 channel\, they’re clearly having a rad time and spreading the love. Stra
 ngely enough\, in a world overflowing with wax museum nostalgia and Deadly
  sentimentalism\, we need the Shred\, now more than ever.\nGrateful Shred

 PER with support from FIB  $17 ADV / $20 DOS 7PM DOORS / 8PM MUSIC ALL AGE
 S  for fans of... Sweeping Promises\, Devo\, Amyl and the Sniffers\, Priso
 n Affair  BIO: Snõõper (the Project) began as a collaboration between lo
 cal Nashville punk mainstay Connor Cummins and Blair Tramel\, an early edu
 cation teacher with a sideline in wickedly funny animation and art. As the
 ir cassette tapes and homemade videos began to find scattered fans around 
 the world\, the duo brought the Project to the live stage in late 2021 and
  Snõõper (the Band) was born.  Featuring one of the wildest live shows o
 ut there\, as well a maelstrom of puppets\, 8 bit animation\, papier-mâch
 é\, whistles\, flashing lights and a whirling dervish of bodies\, Snõõp
 er commits the live act to a studio setting and sets the stage for one of 
 the most promising punk debut albums in decades.   But don’t take our wo
 rd for it\; here’s Henry Rollins\, at-length on the magic of Snõõper: 
  In the briefest of descriptions\, Snõõper is a band who\, in a 33 1/3 r
 pm world\, make 45 rpm music they play at 78 and it completely works.  Eve
 n at this incredible speed\, Snõõper (the kinetic duo of musician Connor
  Cummins and visual/video artist\, Blair Tramel) is super precise instrume
 ntally and skillfully melodic vocally\, even though\, again\, they’re fl
 ooring it almost the entire time. The overall effect is a megadose of extr
 emely cool and unique songs that while at the speed of tomorrow\, would lo
 se their overwhelming fun factor if played any differently. As far as Snõ
 õper vinyl\, there’s been three 7” records: 2020’s Music For Spies\
 , the Snõõper EP released in 2021 and last year’s Town Topic EP. All o
 f them are great but you’d be well advised not to sit down once you’ve
  put a side on\, as you’ll be getting up to flip the record over all too
  soon. Snõõper’s music isn’t for sitting around to anyway.  Divergin
 g from their regular two person line-up\, for Super Snooper\, Connor and B
 lair brought on drummer Cam Sarrett\, bassist Happy Haugen and Ian Teeple 
 on second guitar. The results do justice to the music and has evolved Snõ
 õper’s sound exponentially.  On the fourth listen to Super Snooper now 
 and a new evaluation springs forth: Snõõper don’t play fast. They play
  at the speed of Snõõper. The band is so tight\, the songs so ready for 
 the Bonneville Salt Lake Flats testing site\, one might conclude Snõõper
 ’s just leapin’ and lopin’\, to borrow the title of Sonny Clark’s 
 excellent 1962 Blue Note LP.  Snõõper’s completely happening 11-23-22 
 thirty-four song 27:22 set at Nashville’s Exit/In\, mercifully recorded 
 and released so you can back up your witness testimony as to how smokin’
  the show was with actual audio verification is further proof of how total
 ly ripping this band is and brings to mind a topic insinuated by the live 
 recording but proven true by Super Snooper. Given the brief but awesome gl
 impses into Snõõper’s music afforded by the aforementioned 7”s\, one
  might wonder if the group could hold the line for a full album. The answe
 r is an enthusiastic yes. Super Snooper is great great great and you might
  find yourself playing it over and over as it gets better and better the m
 ore you do.   Speaking selfishly\, I want Snõõper to hurry up and make a
 nother album. This is a really cool record. - Henry Rollins  Snõõper’s
  debut studio album “Super Snõõper” will be released globally on Thi
 rd Man Records on July 14\, 2023.

  project right now. All of his music is recorded in house with his brother
  Hank as the audio engineer. \nBeing from Texarkana\, Arkansas instilled a

 is independently touring the country with his band in a gold van called 
 ‘The Loaf”.  \nBy achieving and producing what feels good in his art\

 6-2025-602105\n  Robby Hoffman is a small\, ex-Hasidic\, queer comedian th
 at can be seen as the breakout star of season 4 of HBO Max’s Hacks\; her
  performance has been hailed as “the future of comedy\,” by Daily Beas
 t\, and as “an original comic talent\,” by the Wall Street Journal. HB
 O recently expanded their business with Hoffman by putting into developmen
 t\, Unentitled\, a starring vehicle for her to also co-write [with Karey D
 ornetto] and executive produce. Hoffman can also be seen in a memorable ro
 le on FX’s buzzy limited series Dying for Sex which she appears in a sex
 ual guide to Michelle Williams’ character.   New York Times comedy criti
 c Jason Zinoman compares her "bulldozing stand-up” to Larry David becaus
 e of her “mountain-out-of-a-molehill kvetching\, but her hilarious rage 
 over people who complain about interruptions during a conversation makes h
 er sound like a modern lesbian Andrew Dice Clay." Zinoman also highlights 
 her podcast Too Far\, as an “addictive listen.”  Robby had an attentio
 n-grabbing set on Netflix’s Verified standup showcase and is currently p
 repping her first hour-long special for US release. She previously filmed 
 an hour-long special “I’m Nervous” which aired on CraveTV in Canada.
    Robby is also a notable TV writer\, having written on The Chris Gethard
  Show (TruTV)\, Workin' Moms (Netflix)\, and Baroness Von Sketch Show (IFC
 ). She won a Daytime Emmy Award for her writing work on Odd Squad (PBS).

 rgh\, PADoors @ 7pmShow @ 8pmAGE RESTRICTION: 18+ or with legal guardianA 
 couple of months after graduating from high school\, Mikey Carnevale (voca
 ls/guitar) and Richard Dotson (bass) got together as The Frights to play a
  one off 30 minute set as sort of a joke. The feeling they got from the cr
 owd in their hometown of San Diego inspired them to become a “real” ba
 nd almost in spite of themselves. Along the way\, they recruited Marc Finn
  (drums) and released You Are Going To Hate This (produced by Zac Carper o
 f FIDLAR) in February 2016. Jordan Clark (guitar) added to the band’s mu
 sical prowess in the ensuing year of touring around North America. The Fri
 ghts signed to Epitaph in early 2018 and got to work on Hypochondriac. Lik
 e You Are Going To Hate This\, the band’s third full-length was produced
  by Zac Carper of FIDLAR (who’s also produced albums for SWMRS and Dune 
 Rats). But for Hypochondriac\, Carnevale took a more deliberate and exacti
 ng approach to his songwriting\, resulting in The Frights’ most nuanced 
 work to date. After a sold out show at The Observatory North Park in their
  hometown of San Diego the same date as the release of the album\, the ban
 d embarked on the Hypochondriac headline tour that is documented on their 
 upcoming live album.\n \nwww.thefrights.com\nfacebook.com/thefrights\nins

 rs @ 7pmShow @ 8pmAGE RESTRICTION: 21+\nSteve Marion\, the critically accl
 aimed–and completely wordless–songwriter and guitarist known as Delica
 te Steve has unveiled a new album called Delicate Steve Sings. Is the albu
 m title a reference to the instantly recognizable “voice” of his guita
 r? Does he actually sing this time? Has he not been singing all along? Tha
 t’s the crux of Sings—Marion is the rare guitarist where you can put o
 n any of his records and know exactly who’s playing. In an indie rock la
 ndscape stuffed end-to-end with guitars and amplifiers\, nobody else sound
 s like this.\nThat unique voice has kept Steve busy in an unpredictable va
 riety of settings. The sheer spread of his work outside his own records—
 collaborating with  and \, playing in  and \, and being sampled by —do
 esn’t mean Steve’s a chameleon. It means he’s singular.\nOne night w
 hile on a trip to Greece\, Marion looked out over the sea while listening 
 to ’s pop standards record Stardust\, a cosmic epiphany washing over him
  about what his next record could be. Delicate Steve Sings is a record cen
 tered on channeling iconic voices with his guitar. In doing so\, Marion is
  casting himself in the role of iconic singers like Willie who make standa
 rds their own. In the process\, he reveals just how singular (dare we say 
 iconic) that voice is. The guitar sings these songs—smoothly\, sweetly\,
  boldly\, and on its own terms.\n\n \nTicket Tier Info:General Admission

 When George Heid III was a child\, whenever he and his father were apart\,
  he would soothe young George with the comforting promise: See you in drea
 mland.This special Thursday Night Jazz performance features the album laun
 ch of George Heid III’s Intentions\, a tribute album to his father’s b
 ravery\, sacrifices\, and the bond the two shared as kindred spirits. It i
 s an album born from two lives deeply intertwined through love and music\,
  sharing the story of their journey together\, from the foundation of a fa
 ther’s legacy to the future that lives on in his son.On the album\, Geor
 ge shared\, “This project is rich with personal meaning\, infused not on
 ly with music but also with my father’s voice. Many audio samples throug
 hout the album come from tapes and recordings he made throughout my life\;
  they’re drawn from voicemails\, videotapes\, and even a 1998 Manchester
  Craftsmen’s Guild interview with Dwayne Dolphin. Some of these samples 
 are obvious\, while others are purposefully subtle—Easter eggs for those
  who listen closely.”And why “Intentions”?George explains that “th
 e word intentions holds many meanings\, each offering a profound connectio
 n to the heart of this project. My father’s intentions were clear from t
 he start: to raise me as a musician and composer and to give me the tools 
 to create and express myself… He believed in me completely\, planting se
 eds of passion that continue to grow.” Like so much of the most beautifu
 l\, complex art\, however\, the album title carries more than one meaning.
  Reflecting on his father’s illness and the reversal of their caretaking
  roles\, George Heid also named the album for the lesson he learned during
  that difficult time: even the purest intentions don’t always lead to th
 e outcomes we wish for.A masterpiece composed with the utmost care and the
  very best intentions\, this emotional and moving album and its intimate a
 ccompanying launch allow George to speak to his father from beyond the bar
 riers of life and death. More than anything\, it is the chance to once aga
 in say\, See you in dreamland.  The limited edition vinyl of George’s a
 lbum Intentions\, pressed locally by Hellbender Vinyl\, will be for sale a

 ok place at home with his father\, George Edward Heid\, a great musician a
 nd true champion of the music. In this environment\, he was always immerse

 off his book tour\, long-time friend\, neighbor\, and City of Asylum Board

 hey Get You\, at Alphabet City. In a combination reading and inside scoop 
 full of insights into his process\, Damon gets personal with City of Asylu
 m audiences to discuss the very subject that drove this hilarious and uniq
 ue amalgam of Black voices: humor.In an interview with NPR\, Damon remarke
 d\, “Black American humor is the best American humor. And I believe that
  because I believe that we have to be the most honest about America\, abou
 t who America is\, what America is\, you know? And when you’re a people 
 who have been vulnerable the entire time…you pay closer attention…That
  sort of clarity\, that sort of honesty\, that sort of reckoning—the bes
 t humor comes from that.”To understand just what Damon means\, all you h
 ave to do is start reading That’s How They Get You. With words that roas
 t\, ignite\, and burn while connecting to and coalescing around a singular
  thesis\, the collection emphasizes how and why Black American humor is un
 iquely transfixing. It is a mixture of not just observational anxieties an
 d stream-of-consciousness lucidities but also acute political clarity abou
 t America. Edited and with an introduction by Damon Young\, the critically
  acclaimed author of What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Blacker\, the colle
 ction features new material from an all-star roster of contributors\, incl

 en on fiddle\, The Arcadian Wild confidently inhabits and explores an inte

 The Arcadian Wild offer up songs of invitation\; calls to come and see\, t
 o find refuge and rest\, to journey and wonder\, to laugh and cry\, to sha
 re joy and community and sing along. \n \nThe band’s 2023 album Welcom
 e marks the start of a captivating new chapter for the genre-bending trio\
 , who returned to the studio with renewed purpose and insight after devoti
 ng the last few years to a series of critically acclaimed singles and EPs.
  Like much of the band’s catalog\, the album blurs the lines between cha
 mber folk and progressive bluegrass\, drawing on everything from country a
 nd classical to pop and choral music with lush harmonies and dazzling fret
 work\, but this time around there’s a rawness to the writing\, an embrac
 e of candor and simplicity that cuts straight to the heart of things like 
 never before. The result is perhaps the most arresting collection yet from
  a band known for its ability to stop listeners dead in their tracks\, an 
 exquisitely beautiful celebration of community\, connection\, and the powe

DESCRIPTION:https://mrsmalls.com/events/vision-video/\nVision Video is a po
 st-punk goth rock band from Athens\, Georgia that injects modern malaise i
 nto classic sounds of the late 70's and 80's.\n\nThe band pays homage to c
 lassics like the Chameleons and The Cure\, while also bringing a refreshin
 g modern element to the genre.\n\nThematically their music explores the ef
 fects of trauma on the human psyche and finding stability and agency in an
  insane world. Having served in Afghanistan with the army and as a firefig
 hter in the civilian world\, lead singer and guitarist Dusty Gannon is no 
 stranger to the darker proclivities of humanity and death itself. "I wante
 d to write music that helped people remember that it's okay to not be okay
 \, but that also doesn't shy away from taking a stern look at the darker a
 spects of our flawed human existence." says Gannon.\n\nThe band's first tw
 o records were met with much critical praise\, such as that from Pitchfork
  stating they create "dreamy tune tailor-made for the sort of wallflower w
 ho sprints to the dancefloor the instant the DJ drops “Age of Consent”
  or “Primary” at Goth Night"\n\nTheir debut LP "Inked in Red" and seco
 nd LP "Haunted Hours"\, were recorded and mixed by Tom Ashton of The March
  Violets at his Sub Von Studios in Athens\, Georgia.\nVision Video will so
 on record their next LP "Modern Horror" at Maze Studios in Atlanta headed 
 by Grammy award winning producer Ben Allen.\n\nThis Event Is All Ages

 ESTRICTION: All AgesThere’s something kinda magical about naming your ba
 nd saturdays at your place. Right off the bat\, it calls to mind images of
  collapsing onto a friend’s couch at the end of a long week\, and the ki
 nd of nights that turn into stories you’ll tell for years to come. For t
 he band from Kalamazoo\, Michigan\, it’s more than just a name\; it’s 
 what’s held them together through college and the strange process of bec
 oming an adult. Whether unpacking tour burnout or the shame of outgrowing 
 your past\, they’re constantly rejecting irony in favor of something muc
 h bolder: sincerity.\nOn their upcoming second full-length\, these things 
 happen (out September 12)\, saturdays at your place take everything that m
 ade their early material resonate—twinkly guitars\, heart-on-sleeve song
 writing\, a distinctly Midwestern ache—and stretch it into something eve
 n more resonant. It’s a record about growing up without growing cold\, a
 nd it’s also a testament to where they’re from\, both literally and mu
 sically\; proof that a band with strong hometown roots can still shake the
  ground.\nFormed by three friends who met at Western Michigan University\,
  the band—Esden Stafne (vocals/bass)\, Gabe Wood (vocals/drums)\, and Mi
 tch Gulish (guitar)—have always used music as a way to map the wretched 
 trajectory of growing up. But on these things happen\, they’ve stopped a
 sking for directions and started finding their own way through the chaos. 
 The result is a heartfelt\, emotionally chaotic and self-aware glimpse at 
 adulthood in all its many complexities.\nA lot of inspiration for the reco
 rd came from Paul Thomas Anderson’s 1999 film\, Magnolia. In the movie\,
  strangers’ lives collide in a grand way\, for no reason. There’s no g
 reater meaning to unfold\, just happenstance\, and similarly\, the album d
 oesn’t offer listeners any new information on what to do once you’ve a
 scended into adulthood\; it simply provides a more relatable cushion.\nThe
  hype for saturdays at your place first kicked off with their 2023 EP\, al
 ways cloudy\, and has since blossomed into a steadily-building wave of mom
 entum. “tarot cards” instantly had fans on the hook with its undeniabl
 e melody and quirky pronunciation\, but the entire record has since gone o
 n to cement their place as one of the most exciting modern emo bands aroun
 d. And while always cloudy was a strong introduction\, these things happen
  marks a decidedly more introspective future for saturdays at your place\;
  it’s also the first music they’ve released since 2023.\nOverall\, the
 se things happen isn’t an album that provides many answers. Instead\, it
 ’s a cathartic companion to survival with friends at your side\, gear in
  the trailer\, and enough hope to keep showing up. For saturdays at your p
 lace\, that’s enough.Ticket Tier Info:General Admission Tickets – Stan

 psychedelic rock\, R&B\, and Afrobeat into a kaleidoscope of rhythm and gr
 oove. Known for their dynamic live performances and innovative composition

 of genre boundaries and their commitment to crafting vibrant\, deeply text

 pter for Polyrhythmics\, delivering a fresh collection of grooves infused 
 with the bold creativity and signature tight-knit musicianship that fans h
 ave come to expect. As they celebrate their 15th anniversary\, the band re
 flects on a decade and a half of musical evolution\, countless miles on th

 /\nA life laid bare\, a wandering search for meaning\, an immersive portal
  into history and its accompanying reverberations. All this and more can b
 e found in Aatish Taseer’s A Return to Self: Excursions in Exile. Part t
 ravelogue\, part memoir\, the work spans from Turkey to Mexico\, exploring
  Aatish Taseer’s uniquely blended identity and asking: Why do certain ci
 ties become epicenters of great historical shifts and sites of unpredictab
 le communities?“I first encountered the work of Aatish Taseer with his 2
 015 novel\, The Way Things Were\, which I covered for Vanity Fair. It was 
 erudite\, searching\, enthralling. His nonfiction is equally compelling—
 his latest book\, A Return to Self: Excursions in Exile\, is full of fasci
 nating journeys that\, taken together\, offer a self-portrait of his searc
 h for belonging. ‘With the idea of home gone\,’ he writes after being 
 banned from Modi’s India\, ‘I stepped out into the world again.’” 
 —Anderson Tepper\, Curator for World LiteratureAfter Aatish Taseer’s I
 ndian citizenship was revoked\, he was exiled from the country he had grow
 n up and lived in for thirty years. This loss\, both practical and spiritu
 al\, sent him on a journey of revisiting the places that had formed his id
 entity\, urging him to ask broader questions about the complex forces that
  make a culture—and a nationality—in the process. Everywhere he goes\,
  from Istanbul to Uzbekistan to India\, the ancient world mixes intimately
  with the contemporary. There\, too\, are the influences of the pandemic\,
  the rise of new food cultures\, and the ongoing cultural battles between 
 regions. In thoughtful prose that combines reportage with romanticism\, T
 aseer casts an incisive eye at what it means to belong to a place that bec
 omes an unstable\, politicized vessel for ideas defined by exclusion and p
 rejudice\, and gets to the human heart of the shifts and migrations that d
 efine our multicultural world.You can purchase a copy of Aatish’s book\,
  A Return to Self\, at City of Asylum Bookstore.About the Author:Aatish Ta
 seer is the author of the memoir Stranger to History: A Son’s Journey Th

 oducing On Topic\, a new series at City of Asylum highlighting current eve
 nts and topical social issues. For our series launch\, we welcome esteemed
  legal scholar Michelle Adams to explore class and race in a discussion of
  her new book\, The Containment: Detroit\, the Supreme Court\, and the Bat
 tle for Racial Justice in the North. Michelle will be joined in conversati
 on by journalist Tony Norman\, who has written on race\, politics\, and cu
 lture in Pittsburgh for over 30 years. Praised by the New Yorker as “pa
 ssionate and well researched\,” The Containment dives deep into a moment
 ous 1974 Supreme Court ruling: In the case of Milliken v. Bradley\, the ju
 stices brought a halt to school desegregation across the North\, and with 
 it\, a halt to the civil rights movement’s struggle for a truly equal ed
 ucation for all. How did this come about\, and why?\nThrough compelling p
 ortraits of a city under stress and key figures—including Detroit’s fi
 rst Black mayor\, Coleman Young\, and Justices Marshall\, Rehnquist\, and 
 Powell—The Containment tells the epic story of the struggle to integrate
  Detroit schools. Michelle chronicles the devoted activists who tried to u
 plift Detroit’s students amid the upheavals of riots\, Black power\, and
  white flight—and how their efforts led to federal judge Stephen Roth’
 s landmark order to achieve racial balance by tearing down the walls separ
 ating the city and its suburbs. The “metropolitan remedy” could have r
 emade the landscape of racial justice. Instead\, the Supreme Court ruled t
 hat the suburbs could not be a part of the effort to integrate—and thus 
 upheld the inequalities that remain in place today.You can purchase a copy
  of Michelle’s book\, The Containment: Detroit\, the Supreme Court\, and
  the Battle for Racial Justice in the North\, at City of Asylum Bookstore.

 er Ani Mari’s debut solo album\, girlfriend\, explores the ambiguities o
 f coming of age in a beautifully precarious world. Across ten warmly comba
 tive tracks\, her songs fight for grace and connection amidst the anxietie
 s\, desires\, heartbreaks\, and oftentimes wearying joie de vivre of being
  young in America’s heartland. \nThough just 21-years-old\, Ani Mari has
  been performing solo\, with her backing band\, and with her folk duo\, An
 i & Kora\, around her home state of Michigan for almost a decade\, along t
 he way sharing stages with The Accidentals\, Lindsay Lou\, May Erlewine\, 
 and Joshua Davis\, among many others. On tracks like “whitefish bay” a
 nd “the prettiest things\,” listeners will hear echoes of the forests 
 and waters of the Upper Peninsula where she was raised\, and the bluegrass
  and folk musical influences she grew up around. While the title track\, 
 “girlfriend\,” might triangulate Ani Mari’s current temperature some
 where between Liz Phair\, Waxahachee\, and Ratboys\, comparisons ultimatel
 y fall short. Compelling\, alive\, humming\, and hungry\, her indie-folk s
 ongwriting is 100% original\, and definitely not to be missed. \ngirlfrien
 d was produced\, recorded\, and mixed by Erik Koskinen\, mastered by Tom G
 arneau\, and released by production house Real-Phonic Records\, St. Paul\,
  Minnesota. Songs by Ani Mari (guitar\, banjo\, lead vocals). Backing musi
 cians include long-time collaborator Kora Melia (violin\, mandolin\, backi

  of the best shows we've ever had in any genre\, is UCB's Big Grande perfo

 rande hit us up about a very special 2 man show he was looking at bringing
  to town with UCB's former artistic director Ronnie Adrian\, we jumped on 
 it!  Bad improv is a tough sit\, I get it. We've all been to that one frie
 nds class show. But good improv? Man\, there's nothing like it. It's a hig
 hwire act of laughter that you can't take your eyes off of- and you'd be h

DESCRIPTION:https://mrsmalls.com/events/boyscott/\nPunctuating wistful\, da
 ydreamy indie rock with surfy guitar hooks\, Boyscott approaches their son
 gs from a hazy\, lighthearted perspective as gentle as ocean breezes. The 
 project first took shape in college dorm rooms and grew into a loose colle
 ctive. Boyscott finished recording their whimsically drawn 2015 debut Goos
 e Bumps before ever playing live\, and continued developing their upbeat\,
  nautical sound on 2024's Spellbound.\n\nBoyscott began in 2015 as an outl
 et for singer/songwriter Scott Hermo's recording experiments while he was 
 attending college in Nashville. Hermo recorded in his dorm room and someti
 mes enlisted friends to help flesh out his soft-edged indie tunes. Fellow 
 schoolmates and musicians Emma Willer\, Tiger Adams\, John Lewandowski and
  Noah Miller joined him to bring a live energy to Hermo's recordings and t
 ogether\, the five musicians completed debut album Goose Bumps and self-re
 leased it in late 2015. When Boyscott began playing live\, school commitme
 nts kept a solid lineup from forming\, but Hermo enlisted a rotating cast 
 of friends and musicians to play shows and go on tours. The band's acclaim
  grew organically through consistent touring and their album\, which caugh
 t on in a grassroots fashion. A physical release of Goose Bumps arrived in
  2019 as a joint release from Top Shelf Records and Babe City Records. The
  most popular songs from Goose Bumps accumulated tens of millions of plays
  on streaming services\, which took the group to entirely new audiences bo
 th in terms of listenership and attendees at their concerts. Boyscott rele
 ased a second album\, Spellbound\, in October of 2024\, continuing to expl
 ore their beachy indie songwriting style.\n\nThis Event Is All Ages

 rnier is a charmingly fresh musical voice whose bubbly attitude and go-gir
 l demeanor underscore a whimsical maturity and intoxicatingly vivacious si
 ng-along magnetism\,” says Grammy nominee Shane Adams.  \nBorn in Coeur 
 d’Alene\, Idaho and hailing from Salt Lake City\, Utah\, Brea Fournier
 ’s songs are alive with the energy of New York City’s twentysomethings
 . A classically trained former musical theatre kid\, Fournier’s music is
  born of the strong melodies and camp of this background\, crossbred with 
 a punk-rock aesthetic she picked up in her angsty teenage years. Fournier
 ’s songs are unapologetically feminine\, upbeat\, and deeply emotional\,
  drawing influence from artists and bands like Paramore and Green Day\, as
  well as 80s acts like Cyndi Lauper\, the GoGos\, and Blondie. \nIn Februa
 ry of 2024\, Fournier released her debut feminist rock opera concept album
  Manic Pixie Dream Girl! with her band and music producer Barb Morrison (F
 ranz Ferdinand/Blondie). The album’s material serves as basis for the up
 coming staged theatrical performance and musical feature film of the same 
 name. A graduate of the renowned Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music\,
  Fournier started the band project Brea Fournier & the Dream Ballet\, and 
 the group performs regularly around New York City and tours the United Sta
 tes.

 29-2025-599664\n  The greatest film soundtrack ever\, PURPLE RAIN rocketed
  Prince to superstardom\, and is still celebrated today as one of the fine
 st and most complete albums ever made.   Half of it's tracklist became Top
  10 hits\, the half are deep cut classics. From the iconic opening of LET'
 S GO CRAZY through the soaring guitar of the title cut that closes it all 
 out - the frantic glam of I WOULD DIE FOR YOU\, and the seductive bassline
  strut of DARLING NIKKI - each song is uniquiely textured\, gorgeously arr
 anged\, and immpeciably performed. It's no wonder why PURPLE RAIN became t
 he high water mark for one of the most relentlessly creative musical geniu
 ses to ever emerge from the wilds of Minnesota (I can think of another who
 's close though).   To tackle such a momentuous album\, we needed a moment
 uous band - and that's THE PRINCE PROJECT\, an internationally touring Pri
 nce tribute band bringing the full power of His Royal Badness to Bottleroc
 ket.  Come and celebrate the iconic record\, live\, in full\, and in order

 s @ 7pmShow @ 8pmAGE RESTRICTION: 18+ or with legal guardian\nWith a sound
  that blends the best of the past and present\, Zinadelphia crafts timeles
 s\, colorful songs that play the long game.\nFollowing a successful trio o
 f singles\, Zinadelphia released her debut Lucky EP in 2023\, and began to
 uring as support for artists who are equally as audacious: Medium Build\, 
 Teddy Swims and most recently\, Tori Kelly. “It’s the most fun I’ve 
 had in my whole life\,” she describes. She built her audience organicall
 y\, performing cross-country for the first time and captivating new fans w
 ith her singular voice and charm.\nEntering 2024\, Zinadelphia brought tog
 ether writer-producers Leroy Clampitt and Gabe Goodman\, working out of LA
  together to create a sound that is everything she’s always wanted. “I
 ’m very much a maximalist\,” she explains. “I wanted to dip into an 
 old Hollywood feel\, almost Burlesque-like.” This aesthetic\, combined w
 ith her love of 60s and 70s icons like The Supremes\, Gloria Gaynor\, and 
 Tammi Terrell\, birthed songs that feel reminiscent of those decades\, whi
 le still being grounded in the present. Her next single\, “Love Over Glo
 ry\,” encapsulates the power that Zinadelphia has always possessed\, now
  on full display. She strives to be realistic\, rather than aspirational\,
  about her struggles\, contrasting darker themes with high energy tempos. 
 Referencing disco motifs with bombastic horns\, funk basslines and a four-
 on-the-floor beat\, the single sets the stage for a new era to come: “It
 ’s the most me I’ve ever felt.”\nZinadelphia embraces life’s “ug
 ly truths” through her songwriting\, using music as an outlet to process
  new experiences and express herself. She captures the highs and lows of w
 omanhood\, marrying vintage aesthetics with a fresh and exciting perspecti

 ode\, New Order  BIO: Modem is a Helsinki-based synth pop duo formed by Ty
 tti Roto and Ville Valavuo in 2020. Having paid their dues in the Finnish 
 punk and indie underground (in bands such as Tamara Luonto\, Plastic Tones
 \, Kissa\, Foreseen and Kohti Tuhoa)\, the duo set out to create electroni
 c pop music and channel their love for the synthetic sounds of the 1980s. 
   The band’s debut album Megalomania analyzes the ambivalent values of t
 he western world. Their danceable synth pop creates a backdrop for lyrical
  themes such as animal rights\, socio-economic inequality\, self help cult
 ure\, the brutal history of European colonialism and its legacy in the mod
 ern age.  Following the DIY ethos of the punk scene\, the band has been ve
 ry self-sufficient in recording\, mixing and artwork\, and released everyt
 hing through their own label Modem Age Records. So far the band has put ou
 t two 12” singles - Elokuvia (2022) and Luxuria (2022) before releasing 
 a full length in April 2024. In the past couple years Modem have been tour
 ing actively in the Finnish club scene\, played some of Finland’s bigges
 t festivals such as Flow Festival\, Sideways and Ruisrock\, and toured bri
 efly in Central Europe and Scandinavia.

 3\n  BAD COP / BAD COP with support from THE IRON ROSES  $20 ADV / $25 DOS
  7PM DOORS / 8PM MUSIC ALL AGES  for fans of... NOFX\, The Distillers\, Th
 e Interrupters  BIO: In the final moments of “Dead Friends\,” the penu
 ltimate track of the new Lighten Up\, Bad Cop Bad Cop guitarist-vocalist S
 tacey Dee sings\, “So try to love your life\, while you can.”  These w
 ords serve as a powerful thesis for Lighten Up (Fat Wreck Chords/Hopeless 
 Records\, September 19\, 2025)\, the SoCal punk group’s fourth full-leng
 th. The album paints a striking portrait of life’s hard-won victories an
 d hard-fought losses.  “I think that’s what I write my songs about\,
 ” Dee says. “Life is hard\, but it's still beautiful. Stop picking the
  hard shit to look at—look at the beautiful stuff too. Lighten up.”  D
 ee and her bandmates—bassist-vocalist Linh Le\, drummer-vocalist Myra Ga
 llarza\, and new guitarist Alex Windsor—know what it takes to persevere.
   Resilience surfaces throughout Lighten Up. In “Strugglinh\,” Le conf
 ronts self-doubt and finds strength\, and in “See Me Now\,” she turns 
 family loss into triumph. “Straight Out of Detox” details a transforma
 tional night in Dee’s life\, and “Note to Self” is her reminder to k
 eep things in perspective\, aided by iconic LA underground rapper 2mex.  P
 laying like a big-hearted sibling to the Jim Carroll Band’s iconic “Pe
 ople Who Died\,” “Dead Friends” has been in the works for years.  
 “This was the first time that I dug in to tell stories that I was too af
 raid to talk about prior\,” Dee says. “We've made records that were un
 apologetically strong\, but the way we got to be unapologetically strong w
 as dealing with things like this.”  Unapologetically personal best descr
 ibes Lighten Up.  “It started with having the girls over on Sundays. I w
 ould cook brunch\, we’d drink tons of bottles of Prosecco\, and we would
  write music together\,” Dee says. “This was family the entire time. I
 t was who we trusted\, who we loved\, who we knew we could work with.”  
 That’s why Bad Cop Bad Cop recorded at the Compound in Long Beach\, home
  to veteran producer Antoine Arvizu (Sublime\, Ryan Bingham). The band lov
 ed recording the singles “Shattered” and “Safe and Legal” there in
  2023 with Arvizu and Dee’s partner\, Migs (Sublime\, Slightly Stoopid\,
  Long Beach Dub Allstars).  “The way that Miguel produces\, he lets you 
 be you until something needs to be added or reeled in. He always says\, 
 ‘Never a dull moment on a record\,” Dee explains. Bad Cop Bad Cop stre
 tched their signature hooky\, melodic punk into unexpected places\, like t
 he jazzy “Las Ventanas\,” the dub-in flected “Note to Self\,” or 
 “Johnny Appleseed\,” a reimagining of the Joe Strummer and the Mescale
 ros classic.  After tracking the instruments\, the band spent 10 intense 1
 2-hour days recording vocals with longtime collaborator John E. Carey Jr. 
 (Old Man Markley\, NOFX\, Get Dead). “The singing was the most important
  part for us. We really tried things out\,” Dee says\, adding that Galla
 rza stepped up to sing third harmony for the first time.  Lighten Up also 
 benefits from Windsor\, an expert guitarist who not only shreds (check out
  the end of “I4NI”) but whose music theory knowledge proved invaluable
 . “Alex's guitar playing is just so fantastic and has really elevated ou
 r songwriting\, truly\,” Dee says  Everything about Lighten Up feels ele
 vated and genuine. “This was the first time we didn’t give a fuck abou
 t what anyone else was doing or wanted us to do. Lighten Up was for us” 
 Dee says. “We had a complete and total ball making it and we love it so 
 much”

 HUCK with support TBA  $15 ADV / $18 DOS 7PM DOORS / 8PM MUSIC ALL AGES  f
 or fans of... Snõõper\, Gouge Away\, The Spits\, Amyl and the Sniffers  
 BIO: In the messiness of daily life\, one rule rings true above all else: 
 artistry always beats mastery. No amount of fine technique or studied prec
 ision can match the release of real feeling\, the genuine thrill of human 
 bodies and spirits finding each other in the heat of the night. On Bite th
 e Hand That Feeds (Famous Class)\, Atlanta’s Upchuck offer such real fee
 ling in droves. Channeling the speed of youth and the heaviness of a flesh
 y\, lived life in equal proportion\, Upchuck’s second LP is a Trojan Hor
 se par excellence\, craftily smuggling in waves of sentimental emotion and
  clever pop songwriting under a veil of pulsing rhythms and scorching riff
 s. They are loyal to no genre or stylistic strictures—Bite the Hand That
  Feeds shifts effortlessly between fuzzed out\, Sabbath-worthy dirges and 
 ripping\, Spits-worship punk\, hardcore-freak-psychedelia and bright garag
 e pop. Where other bands might falter under the weight of stylistic overlo
 ad\, Upchuck carve forward across the cement with a sense of charmed ease.
  What binds Upchuck together is a purity of intention\, an organic loyalty
  to a thick knot of uncalculated friendships\, struggles\, and desires. Th
 ese are songs about the joy of continuing to live\, songs that find each o
 ther in the rush of a crushing reality\, propelling the listener onward to
 wards a collective release\, however brief it may last. Themes of survivin
 g through the night\, youth-blinded love\, cheap champagne soaked back-all
 ey parties\, and chaotic street protests are subsumed under a single unify
 ing thread: the needs we have for one another\, our shared hunger for conn
 ection. In a world saturated with arbitrary rules and paper-thin moralism\
 , Upchuck offer freedom through sensation\, a type of unserious transcende
 nce found through the swirl of bodies melting into one another in the pass
 ion of dance. With Bite the Hand That Feeds\, Upchuck isn’t trying to te
 ll anyone how to live. Rather\, they are simply trying to find a way to ma
 ke life more worth living for both themselves and their friends—if the m
 usic compels you to move\, you might as well consider yourself their frien
 d too.  Formed in 2018 through shared connections in Atlanta’s teeming s
 kate scene\, Upchuck’s musical aspirations have always been uncomplicate
 d. They play for each other\, and for anyone who is willing to move alongs
 ide them—there are no trappings of genre worship or social politicking i
 n their sound\, only an open spirit of friendly connection. As guitarist H
 off recollects\, “When we started the band\, all we wanted was to be lou
 der and have more fun than everyone else—we wanted to have as many amps 
 as possible onstage\, and we wanted to play with our favorite bands\, that
 ’s it.” 2022 saw the release of their first LP\, Sense Yourself (Famou
 s Class)\, which sports a cover photo of vocalist KT gripping a rusted mic
  as blood gushes down her body from a gash to her forehead\, perfectly enc
 apsulating the debut record’s ferocious sense of abandon. Shortly after 
 the release of Sense Yourself\, Upchuck absconded to Souther California to
  record Bite the Hand That Feeds\, enlisting the production talents of Ty 
 Segall and the airy reprieve of his secluded Topanga Canyon home studio. U
 pchuck credits Segall\, who recorded the entire record live to tape over t
 he span of five days\, with helping to elevate the arrangements of their s
 econd record to bold new heights—fans of Segall’s extensive catalog wi
 ll undoubtedly recognize the shadow of his creative touch in Bite the Hand
  That Feeds’ commanding\, layered drum polyrhythms\, tasteful use of odd
 ball effects\, and fuzzed out\, every-guitar-pushed-into-the-red ethos.  A
 ll the same\, final credit for Upchuck’s evolution from Sense Yourself t
 o Bite the Hand That Feeds must be paid to the band itself. Following the 
 release of their debut LP\, Upchuck embarked upon a break-neck string of l
 ive shows\, touring alongside the likes of Segall’s Fuzz\, Amyl and the 
 Sniffers\, Negative Approach\, OFF!\, and Subhumans. The razor tight focus
  of Bite the Hand That Feeds was forged in the fire of these live shows\, 
 speaking directly to the power of their in-person presence—these are son
 gs meant to be heard pressed up against a barricade\, blasted through dime
 d guitar amps placed so close to your ears that you can practically reach 
 out and touch them. Live footage of Upchuck’s set is an undeniable spect
 acle within itself: before a single note is hit\, oceans of teenage degene
 rates\, punks\, hoodie laden indie kids\, and sneaker clad skaters thrust 
 forth into a miasma of moshing bodies\, beaming smiles and flailing limbs 
 shooting out in every direction as the band teases the crowd with washes o
 f blown out feedback. Upchuck places heavy emphasis upon the special quali
 ty of these shared moments with the crowd\, often putting on their own sho
 ws in repurposed locations like abandoned munitions warehouses—legend ha
 s it that a friend crowd surfed in a stolen shopping cart at one such ware
 house show\, leading to the bloody injury featured on the cover of Sense Y
 ourself—and frequently enlisting the talents of special guests like Faye
  Webster onstage. Speaking on the importance of live performance to the ba
 nd’s overall outlook\, KT does not mince words: “With all of the shit 
 life throws at you every day\, sometimes I just need to release something
 —I need to feel freaky\, to lean into my wild alter-ego. That’s what w
 e want to give other people too—we wanna create a space for people to co
 me and work out whatever has been dragging them down\, but together\, all 
 at once.”  Lyrically\, Bite the Hand That Feeds is passionately impressi
 onistic\, following the reflections of a charmingly unreliable narrator as
  she clocks the shortcomings of the world around her. In the words of KT\,
  “I’m trying to point things out as I see them\, but without critiquin
 g anyone—I see the ways certain people act and feel like I’ve got to s
 ay something about it\, but I’m not trying to pretend like I don’t act
  the same way sometimes. It’s all you do you\, live and let live.” Ope
 ning track “Freaky” places KT’s self-described alter-ego front and c
 enter\, riffing upon her hunger to let loose\, her hunger to lean into the
  open-ended freedom of the long\, chaotic night. “Freaky” is an ode to
  unbridled joy\, carving out a space to live loudly in the face of daily s
 truggles. “Freedoom” spins this same sense of unfocused chaos on its h
 ead\, negatively refiguring the racing pulse of “Freaky” in the form o
 f flashing depictions of sprawling street protests\, bodies ducking in and
  out of cover under the glare of police sirens. Riffing upon the band’s 
 lived experiences with protesting against the state injustices that have p
 lagued their hometown\, “Freedoom” pounces with a sense of youthful hu
 nger that convincingly drags the post-’68 fever-pitch spirit of The Roll
 ing Stones’ “Street Fighting Man” into the 21st century. These theme
 s of unrest and darting glances weave in and out of the record\, such as o
 n “Shaken\,” which reflects upon the ways in which such moments of sca
 ttered chaos create complicated webs of complicity between all involved—
 who is using who\, and to what end? That said\, Bite the Hand That Feeds i
 s far from a doom and gloom record. Its heaviest moments are counteracted 
 by bursts of goofy levity\, injecting natural breaths of fresh air into th
 e LP’s frantic cadence. “Crashing” embodies this lightness directly\
 , painting a portrait of what it feels like to continue living in the face
  of a young love that has come to an untimely end. Moving with the fragile
  emotionality of someone emerging into the light of day with a post-amphet
 amine hangover\, “Crashing” burns with a gentle sweetness\, the sadnes
 s of a love that has come to a close balanced out by the non-judgmental re
 frain\, “I’m nice enough to let you live.” Throughout Bite the Hand 
 That Feeds\, the trials of moving from day to day are stripped of petty mo
 ralizing\, clearing mental space to reflect upon the pleasures and desires
  that make it all worth going through in the first place.  On Bite the Han
 d That Feeds\, Upchuck’s signature blend of high-impact style is put on 
 full\, muscular display. “Freaky” jolts with weaving jungle-rhythms th
 at evoke the finer side of such oddball-punk forebears as The Coneheads an
 d CCTV\, balanced against a sly\, Hunx and His Punx-adjacent melodicism th
 at places the song squarely in garage-pop territory without interrupting i
 ts overall frenetic cadence. “Crashing” showcases the band’s evolved
  songwriting prowess\, coursing through cutely sentimental hooks that conj
 ure shades of a more rosy-tinted\, not yet roadworn Royal Headache. Elsewh
 ere\, Upchuck burrows fully into thundering doom theatrics\, such as on 
 “Toothless\,” which whips a series of massive\, Iommi-worthy riffs int
 o a cascading\, joyous fury. “Long Gone” pushes these heavier tendenci
 es to an extreme\, plodding like a rusted car sputtering on the brink of c
 ollapse before opening out onto a chilling highway of psych-inflected expa

 tracks like “Not Your Average Girl” inject a sense of playful good hum

 13-2025-612265\n  We're saluting the Prince of Darkness with the Sabbath r

 D\, the second album from BLACK SABBATH and the one that convinced folks i
 n September 1970 that the devil was real\, and he played a mean electric g
 uitar.  Just four months after their genre bending debut record hit shelve
 s - Ozzy and Co. found themselves back in the studio. The songwriting was 
 free and easy\, springing out of improvised jams at their legendary live s
 hows - and in quick succession the band found themselves stumbling upon th
 e iconic fuzzy riffs of Paranoid\, Iron Man\, and Electric Funeral. They e
 ven got into the headspace to turn out the sublimely subdued Planet Carava
 n - a song that showcased Sabbath's true musical brilliance even a little 
 Satanic Panic couldn't deny.  So - nine months after they had first create
 d the very idea of "Heavy Metal"\, Paranoid hit the shelves. And the siren
 s that open War Pigs made it clear. The 60's were over. Grab a ticket for 
 Altamont. Take the flowers out of your hair and shout at the devil. Or\, a
 s Ozzy said - "Geezer came up with these heavy duty lyrics about death and
  destruction. No wonder we never got any chicks at our gigs."   What bette
 r way to celebrate it all than LIVE\, IN FULL\, and IN ORDER - just like w
 hen you first dropped the needle on it all those years ago. Plus a few ext
 ras at the end too.

 Topic series continues with a book talk celebrating author Nina Sharma’s
  debut memoir in essays\, The Way You Make Me Feel: Love in Black and Brow
 n. Packed with humor\, love\, and anecdotes in allyship\, the work travers
 es the Asian and Black interracial relationship between Nina and her husba
 nd\, Quincy. In a series of sensual and sparkling essays\, Nina Sharma ch
 ronicles her and Quincy’s love story\, examining how their Black and Asi
 an relationship becomes the lens through which she moves through and under
 stands the world. Nina reckons with caste\, race\, colorism\, and mental h
 ealth\, moving from her seemingly idyllic suburban childhood to her and Qu
 incy’s early sweeping romance and onward to their marriage.Growing up\, 
 she hears her parents talk about the racism they experienced at the hands 
 of white America. As an adult\, she confronts the complexities of American
  racism and the paradox of her family’s disappointment when she starts d
 ating a Black man. While watching The Walking Dead\, Nina dives into the e
 erie parallels between the brutal death of Steven Yeun’s character and t
 he murder of Vincent Chin. She examines the trailblazing Mira Nair film Mi
 ssissippi Masala\, revolutionary in its time for depicting a love story be
 tween an Indian woman and a Black man on screen\, and considers why interr
 acial relationships are so often assumed to include white people. And as s
 he and Quincy decide whether to start a family\, they imagine a universe i
 n which Vice President Kamala Harris could be their time-traveling daughte
 r.Written with a keen critical eye and seamlessly weaving in history\, pop
  culture\, and politics\, The Way You Make Me Feel reaffirms the idea that
  allyship is an act of true love.You can purchase a copy of Nina’s book\

 2025-576205\n  Hailing from Chicago\, Chris Redd is a multifaceted talent

  Book It? Chris obviously sprang onto the scene with a 5 season stint on S
 NL - where he made a particular mark with his rap parody's\, including the
  Emmy Award winning "Come Back\, Barack". Add in a memorable turn as a Tyl
 er\, the Creator-esque rapper in the cult classic Lonely Island film Popst
 ar\, various scene stealing roles across film and tv\, and an undeniably g
 reat Standup act\, and you've got a recipe for one of the most in demand a
 cts in clubs across the country. We're thrilled to be welcoming Chris Redd
  to Bottlerocket for the very first time!   Extended Bio: Redd’s first o
 ne-hour special\, “Why Am I Like This?” was released in October 2022 a

 ey of self-discovery\, pulling from his experiences starting therapy amid 
 the height of the pandemic and taking a look at his life with a newfound p
 erspective.    Redd hosts Netflix’s automotive makeover series “Resurr
 ected Rides.” The show is produced by Rick Hurvitz\, who co-created MTV
 ’s cult series “Pimp My Ride.” Last year\, he appeared in Amazon Pri
 me Video and MGM Studios’ hit holiday feature “Candy Cane Lane\,” st
 arring opposite Eddie Murphy and Tracee Ellis Ross. He will next star in A

 ey Deschanel and Charlie Cox from director Jessica Swale. Additionally\, R
 edd lends his vocal talents to Ramy Youssef’s upcoming Amazon animated s
 eries “#1 Happy Family USA”. He co-created and voices a lead role in a
  yet-to-be-titled project from Broadway Video and Audible.    Redd is the 
 co-creator\, writer\, and star of Peacock’s scripted comedy series\, “
 Bust Down”\, which premiered in March 2022. He was a repertory player on
  NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” for 5 seasons.    In addition to acting
  and writing\, Redd is a rapper and stand-up comedian who performs across 
 the country and has toured the United States and Europe with The Second Ci
 ty Touring Company. He received the Emmy Award in 2018 for Outstanding Ori
 ginal Music and Lyrics for the “SNL” song “Come Back\, Barack.”   
  In 2019\, Redd released his debut stand-up album\, “But Here We Are.”
  Redd starred in the independent horror film “Scare Me” and can be see
 n in the comedy films “Vampires vs. the Bronx\,” “Deep Murder\,” 
 “The House\,” and “A Futile and Stupid Gesture.”    He appeared in
  the 2016 film “Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping”\, opposite Kathy B
 ates in the Netflix original comedy series “Disjointed” and has been f
 eatured in Netflix’s “Wet Hot American Summer\,” NBC’s “Will & G
 race\,” Netflix’s “Love\,” TV’ Land’s “Teachers\,” Comedy

 underbird Music Hall4053 Butler Street\, Pittsburgh\, PADoors @ 7PMShow @ 
 8PMAGE RESTRICTION: 18+ or with legal guardianARCHERS combine massive melo
 dies and crushing heaviness with unrivaled passion and precision. The musi
 c of the Midwestern quartet connects deeply via confessional tales of brok
 en hearts and mental anguish\, building an intimate sense of community wit
 h outsiders from all corners of the world.   After years of honing their
  craft on the road\, at major rock festivals and touring alongside bands s
 uch as Asking Alexandria\, Catch Your Breath\, From Ashes to New\, Magnoli
 a Park and Imminence\, the band has developed a knack for delivering high 
 octane\, head turning performances that resonate with their fans while con
 tinuing to win over a dedicated army of new fans with each performance.\n
  The Wisconsin band’s momentum is a testament to the strength of its so
 aring songs and magnetic live performances. Its fourth EP\, Temporary High
 \, was produced by Matt Good (Hollywood Undead\, Sleeping With Sirens) and
  blends energetic pop and visceral metalcore into an evocative sound.  \n
 Engaging frontman Nathanael Pulley and dynamic guitarist Ben Koehler first
  came together under the Archers banner in 2015\, with the later addition 
 of funk and R&B-loving bassist and vocalist Oscar Porter and hard rock-wea
 ned drummer Grayson Mesarosh crystalizing the band’s definitive line-up.
  Each of the four came into heavy music via different gateways\, from a mi
 xture of metalcore and melodic rock bands as diverse as the Vans Warped To
 ur line-up\, from pop-punk hooks to devastating breakdowns.  \nDeterminat
 ion\, passion\, and authenticity are the beating heart of Archers. Even as
  Archers’ mission expands worldwide\, the quartet is determined to remai
 n true to themselves. This is evident to their most diehard fans\, and it 
 is precisely why what they are doing connects so profoundly.  \n \nTicke

 un/\nCity of Asylum Writer-in-Residence Rania Mamoun has curated a beautif
 ul film screening featuring the work of Syrian filmmaker Reem Alghazzi. Re
 em is presenting her film Becoming Iphigenia\, with a moderated discussion
  to follow the screening. The film will be screened in the original Arabic
 \, with English subtitles. Becoming Iphigenia (ان تکوني افیغی
 نیا) is a feature-length creative documentary. The film follows the sto
 ry of nine young Syrian women who have fled to Germany to escape the war a
 nd\, for some\, to escape the society at home. The women hail from differe
 nt walks of life and communities in Syria\, and they were brought together
  on stage at the Volksbühne in Berlin for roles in a modern adaptation of
  Euripides’ Iphigenia written by playwright Mohammad al-Attar and direct
 ed by Omar Abusaada. In creating this film\, Reem Alghazzi had close acce
 ss to the cast of non-professional actors. She filmed the preparations\, r
 ehearsals\, discussions\, and the premiere\, as well as the women’s live
 s in Germany outside the theatre. As the women spent more and more time to
 gether\, they discovered that though they had left to escape pain and poss
 ible death\, they still carried these hardships wherever they went. Could 
 they escape the past\, family\, society\, and themselves?This fourth insta
 llment of our Writer-in-Residence series is a testament to the connection 
 City of Asylum residents make with members of the Pittsburgh community. Ou

 urday August 23\, 2025Thunderbird Music Hall4053 Butler Street\, Pittsburg
 h\, PADoors @ 7pmShow @ 8pmAGE RESTRICTION: 21+Ferdinand The Bull crafts s
 weeping indie folk built on a foundation of eloquent melodicism and the sw
 eetest of vocal harmonies. At turns intimate and grand\, imbued with a shi
 mmering inner warmth\, Something Into Nothing is a comfortable\, burnished
  jewel-box of a record\, as easy as a summer evening. Beautifully wrought 
 and soft as worn denim\, it stands ready to soundtrack your most wonderful
 ly destination-free backroads rambles.   \nSomething Into Nothing also m
 arks a new chapter in the musical journey of songwriter Nick Snyder\; the 
 realization\, that at its core\, this is truly his ship to captain. “Wor
 king on these songs mostly alone led me to the realization that it was tim
 e to rely more on myself\, instead of looking for the approval and input f
 rom others” explains Snyder. “Ferdinand the Bull has always been my cr
 eative and emotional outlet\, but to me life is about collaborating and do
 ing things together. At one point\, we counted my friends who were at one 
 point in this band and played at least a live show or two\, and we quickly
  ran out of fingers – and toes!”\nRecorded alongside the old plaster a
 nd new tile\, Something Into Nothing is both a celebration of the journey 
 Snyder has taken with Ferdinand the Bull and a return to his roots. These 
 are songs written over the years – he began writing “Someday\, Someday
 ” at nineteen and only just recently finished it\, while “Texas Cigare
 tte” is a much more contemporary creation. The first room to see the ham
 mer was\, unsurprisingly\, the home studio. “It really made me feel so y
 oung and creative again\, and I’m so excited for the future and everythi
 ng to come\,” tells Snyder. “I’ve been playing these songs live for 
 years\, and I needed to get them out for everyone to hear.”\nRecorded wi
 th friend and producer Dylan Mckinstry of the band Upstate\, bassist Jon L
 eff\, and drummer Dan Leon\, Something Into Nothing\, is at once a nod to 
 the past and a promise of things to come. It is a testament to the idea th
 at sometimes the only way to gain control is to let things go. “Fighting
  the current can be why you’re stuck in place\, instead of moving forwar
 d the way you’re supposed to go. Just like a leaf in a river. It might s
 ound contradictory\, but contradiction is a big part of being human.”Bas
 ed in Pittsburgh\, Pennsylvania\, the Ferdinand the Bull delivers the spir
 it of the Appalachian highlands to venues and festivals thousands of miles
  away\, including an official showcase at SXSW in 2022\, and sharing stage
 s alongside powerhouse artists such as Charles Wesley Godwin\, Josh Ritter
 \, Dustbowl Revival\, Mo Lowda and the Humble\, and the Ghost of Paul Reve

 ND RUN CLUB  $18 ADV / $20 DOS 7PM DOORS / 8PM MUSIC ALL AGES  for fans of
 ... Jhariah\, Will Wood  BIO: Sarah and the Safe Word is a cabaret rock ba
 nd from Atlanta. Since their formation in 2015\, the band has carved out a
  niche with their infectious energy\, boundary-pushing creativity\, and un
 apologetically queer ethos.  From the start\, Sarah and the Safe Word have
  made waves – catching the attention of music lovers and industry leader
 s alike. In 2017\, Vans Warped Tour founder Kevin Lyman personally invited
  them to join the legendary tour’s lineup\, cementing their place as one
  of the most exciting new acts in alternative music. Their cameo on the CW
 's The Originals — where they performed during a queer werewolf-witch we
 dding — showcased their theatrical flair to a wider audience. Their albu
 m “Red Hot and Holy” was praised by Alternative Press as a “contende
 r for Debut of the Year.” Sarah and the Safe Word have since embarked on
  numerous national and international tours\, leaving a trail of sated audi
 ences in their wake.  In 2019\, the band signed with Take This To Heart Re
 cords\, who described them as “a band that exists in two worlds\, each a
  century apart.” Their sound and aesthetic seamlessly bridge these world
 s: one is the smoky\, velvet-lined speakeasy of a bygone era\, where tales
  of swashbucklers\, femme fatales\, and racing demons play out over lush c
 abaret-inspired instrumentation. The other is the raw\, sweat-drenched und
 erground of modern punk shows\, where a collectivist spirit reigns supreme
 \, and every show is a celebration of liberation\, self-expression\, and c
 ommunity without borders.  Sarah and the Safe Word’s live performances a
 re as much a spectacle as a concert\, weaving bold narratives and theatric
 al flourishes into their punk-meets-cabaret sound. The band’s message is
  one of radical inclusion\, embracing their fans as a family of outsiders\
 , dreamers\, and storytellers. In a world where authenticity is currency\,
  Sarah and the Safe Word aspire to be rich beyond measure\, offering a spa
 ce where everyone can feel seen\, heard\, and celebrated.

 ESTRICTION: 21+M.E.L.T. (formerly Melt) is a Pittsburgh-based fuzz rock tr
 io composed of Joey Troupe (guitar/vocals)\,James May (bass/vocals)\, and 
 J.J. Young (drums/vocals) — three veterans of the Steel City’s musicsc
 ene. Troupe cut his teeth in Paddy the Wanderer\; May brings a heavy low e
 nd from AberrantKingdom and Spare Arrows\; and Young’s prolific output i
 ncludes over 10 projects\, a solo venture underthe name BITE\, and co-foun
 ding the music media collective Steel City Death Club.\nSince releasing th
 eir self-titled debut in 2021\, M.E.L.T. has earned a reputation for blist
 ering\, riff-drivencompositions and high-voltage live shows\, often marked
  by their signature extraterrestrial aesthetic.Along the way\, they’ve s
 hared stages with heavyweights like Lightning Bolt\, Pigsx7\, The MysteryL
 ights\, Rickshaw Billies Burger Patrol\, and Silver Synthetic — a testam
 ent to their growing stature inthe underground rock scene. Their sophomore
  LP\, Replica of Man (2023)\, garnered critical acclaim andexpanded their 
 reach beyond Pittsburgh\, setting the stage for their debut U.S. tour.\nIn
  early 2025\, the band rebranded as M.E.L.T. due to trademark conflicts an
 d is now gearing up torelease their highly anticipated third album — ush
 ering in a new era while staying true to their raw\,genre-defying sound.\n

DESCRIPTION:https://cityofasylum.org/program/thursday-night-jazz-tony-campb
 ell/\nIt’s the last Thursday Night Jazz concert of the summer! We’re g
 oing out with a bang as Pittsburgh Jazz Society’s Hall of Fame inductee 
 Tony Campbell takes to the stage to honor the life and music of two great 
 saxophonists: Eric Kloss and Richie Cole. Eric Kloss was born in Greenvil
 le in 1949\, and when he sat in with legends at Pittsburgh’s Crawford Gr
 ill\, “the 12-year-old alto player wasn’t going to get any breaks due 
 to his age or his blindness” (JazzTimes). That was just the start of Eri
 c Kloss’s career\, which saw him collaborate with such legends as Chick 
 Corea. Eric was also a frequent guest on Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood for
  over 25 years.Richie Cole\, the “keeper of the bebop flame” (WBGO)\, 
 developed his own “alto madness” style in the 1970s and recorded over 
 50 albums. He spent his last years in Pittsburgh\, where he was an elder i
 n the jazz community until his death of natural causes in 2020.Tony and an
  incredible lineup of Pittsburgh jazz legends will perform tracks from Eri
 c and Richie’s extensive discographies\, paying homage to these two hero
 es of the genre. Featured Musicians:Tony Campbell: saxophoneVictor Garzot
 to: pianoDwayne Dolphin: bassRoger Humphries: drumsAbout the Artist:Tony C
 ampbell was inducted into the Pittsburgh Jazz Society’s Hall of Fame in 
 2010. His musical journey began in the Hill District in 1973. At the age o
 f 13\, Tony joined a band called The Deltones. In 1979\, Tony attended Ber
 klee College of Music and returned to Pittsburgh in 1982 to study at the U
 niversity of Pittsburgh under Dr. Nathan Davis. At the age of 22\, he reco
 rded and toured with Roy Ayers\, and in the same year\, joined Roger Humph
 ries and RH Factor. In 1990\, Tony moved to New York City and joined Duke 
 Ellington’s Sophisticated Ladies as lead alto saxophonist in a 10-piece 
 orchestra for a 16-week tour of the US. In 2000\, Tony came home and start
 ed teaching\, joined the Roger Humphries Big Band\, and became the lead al
 to player. He also started his own band\, The Tony Campbell Band. Currentl
 y\, Tony is performing\, recording\, producing\, teaching\, and holding ja
 zz jam sessions that feature some of the best young up-and-coming talent i
 n the Pittsburgh region. His mission is to keep the great American music o
 f jazz alive forever\, for all to enjoy and experience as he does. His lat
 est recording\, Blues\, Ballads and Beyond\, was produced in 2022 and is c
 urrently available on all streaming platforms and at Dorsey Records.About

 025-577859\n  Hailing from Chicago\, Chris Redd is a multifaceted talent w
 hose work spans stand-up comedy\, film\, television and music.   Why'd We 
 Book It? Chris obviously sprang onto the scene with a 5 season stint on SN
 L - where he made a particular mark with his rap parody's\, including the 
 Emmy Award winning "Come Back\, Barack". Add in a memorable turn as a Tyle
 r\, the Creator-esque rapper in the cult classic Lonely Island film Popsta
 r\, various scene stealing roles across film and tv\, and an undeniably gr
 eat Standup act\, and you've got a recipe for one of the most in demand ac
 ts in clubs across the country. We're thrilled to be welcoming Chris Redd 
 to Bottlerocket for the very first time!   Extended Bio: Redd’s first on
 e-hour special\, “Why Am I Like This?” was released in October 2022 an
 d is streaming now on MAX. The material was mined from his personal journe
 y of self-discovery\, pulling from his experiences starting therapy amid t
 he height of the pandemic and taking a look at his life with a newfound pe
 rspective.    Redd hosts Netflix’s automotive makeover series “Resurre
 cted Rides.” The show is produced by Rick Hurvitz\, who co-created MTV
 ’s cult series “Pimp My Ride.” Last year\, he appeared in Amazon Pri
 me Video and MGM Studios’ hit holiday feature “Candy Cane Lane\,” st
 arring opposite Eddie Murphy and Tracee Ellis Ross. He will next star in A
 mazon MGM Studios‘ highly anticipated rom-com\, “Merv” alongside Zoo
 ey Deschanel and Charlie Cox from director Jessica Swale. Additionally\, R
 edd lends his vocal talents to Ramy Youssef’s upcoming Amazon animated s
 eries “#1 Happy Family USA”. He co-created and voices a lead role in a
  yet-to-be-titled project from Broadway Video and Audible.    Redd is the 
 co-creator\, writer\, and star of Peacock’s scripted comedy series\, “
 Bust Down”\, which premiered in March 2022. He was a repertory player on
  NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” for 5 seasons.    In addition to acting
  and writing\, Redd is a rapper and stand-up comedian who performs across 
 the country and has toured the United States and Europe with The Second Ci
 ty Touring Company. He received the Emmy Award in 2018 for Outstanding Ori
 ginal Music and Lyrics for the “SNL” song “Come Back\, Barack.”   
  In 2019\, Redd released his debut stand-up album\, “But Here We Are.”
  Redd starred in the independent horror film “Scare Me” and can be see
 n in the comedy films “Vampires vs. the Bronx\,” “Deep Murder\,” 
 “The House\,” and “A Futile and Stupid Gesture.”    He appeared in
  the 2016 film “Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping”\, opposite Kathy B
 ates in the Netflix original comedy series “Disjointed” and has been f
 eatured in Netflix’s “Wet Hot American Summer\,” NBC’s “Will & G
 race\,” Netflix’s “Love\,” TV’ Land’s “Teachers\,” Comedy

 e most recently portrayed the character of ‘Gary Williams’ on the NBC

 9\n  Actress and Comedian Rachel Feinstein is a favorite among fans and fe

  2024\, her Netflix standup special Big Guy premiered in May 2024 on the s

 onal intimacy with someone whose job it is to save people’s lives. Chock
  full of her signature “amazing impersonations” (Vulture)\, Big Guy en
 dears us to the loveable hodgepodge of characters in Rachel’s world.  Wh
 y'd We Book It? Rachel is my mom's favorite comedian - and my mom is a pre

  Bottlerocket visit with a whole new hour of material in tow - my mom will
  be there\, why wouldn't you?   Extended Bio: Feinstein appeared on Comedy

 m Squad\, Pool Kids  BIO: Hailing from Phoenix\, Arizona - a city known fo
 r its triple-digit temperatures and the kind of existential dread that can
  only come from living in a giant oven - Sydney moves through life with gu
 itar in one hand and an anxiety disorder in the other.   Her debut album\,
  maybe i will see you at the end of the world\, released in 2020\, earned 
 glowing reviews from publications like NPR\, Refinery29\, Guitar World\, a
 nd other outlets that sound very impressive when listed all together like 
 this. Critics praised her for her honesty\, wit\, and ability to evade an 
 impending mental breakdown by instead writing a really good song. Sydney h
 as had a busy five years since then\, writing and releasing her second alb
 um somebody in hell loves you in between a relentless touring schedule - s
 upporting bands like Jimmy Eat World\, Dashboard Confessional\, The Front 
 Bottoms\, Oso Oso\, Spanish Love Songs\, and Michigander.   With songs tha
 t pair unforgettable melodies and sick guitar riffs over the general feeli
 ng that you left the stove on\, Sydney has been quietly building a discogr
 aphy that speaks directly to the overthinking masses.

DESCRIPTION:https://mrsmalls.com/events/wax-jaw-3/\nWax Jaw built their sou
 nd on a drive to play high-energy shows that would leave no audience membe
 r standing still. Born within Philadelphia’s expansive music scene\, the
  band fuses dynamic and fast-paced punk tunes with emotionally charged lyr
 ics\, inspiring fans to search their hearts while sweating it out on the d
 ance floor. The five-piece outfit has captured the raw emotion and electri
 city of their on-stage performances in their debut album\, It Takes Guts!\
 , which is set to be released via Born Loser Records on October 10\, 2025.
 \nIt Takes Guts! holds joy and suffering in the same breath. The album exp
 lores themes of addiction\, sexual liberation\, and self-worth\, offering 
 an authentic reflection of lead singer Shane Morgan’s lived experience a
 s a transmasculine person. Despite its heavier themes\, It Takes Guts! pla
 yfully embraces the ironies of life and the undeniable catharsis that come
 s from choosing to be sexy or sleazy when the mood strikes. The instrument
 ation of the record mirrors its lyrical duality\, stitching together jagge
 d punk riffs and new-wave danceability. It’s music that invites both mov
 ement and introspection\, with each track built to hit home and blow out y
 our speakers.\n\nThis Event Is All Ages

  ALL AGES  for fans of... Hotline TNT\, Joyce Manor\, Strange Ranger  BIO:
  In nearly a decade\, songwriter Sonia Weber’s ability to pen precise ly
 rics and memorable riffs has become laser-focused. As a result\, the songs
  feel like they’ve been assembled with all the intention and care of a m
 ixtape to a high-stakes crush.   Caleb Misclevitz\, A.P. Fiedler\, Derek M
 cNeil\, and Ellie Conroy round out the band\, bringing the giant loud guit
 ar rock feeling these songs require. The Portland outfit crafts songs big 
 enough to fill an arena\, while simultaneously conjuring the emotional int
 imacy of making out in the bathroom of your favorite karaoke bar.   Alien 
 Boy does this by harnessing the raw power of PDX’s Wipers’ but not bei
 ng afraid to embrace the pop catchiness of rock titans like Oasis or Third
  Eye Blind\, all while crafting a tone and power distinctly their own. Whe
 ther listened to in your headphones in bed or witnessed live in person\, A
 lien Boy leaves an emotional crater that’ll keep you coming back for mor

 nALEX BERGAN BIO:\nAs a native of Iowa\, Alex began writing music at the a
 ge of 15. Like many artists\, he’s navigated through countless avenues t
 rying to find the most honest and authentic version of his sound. Once a s
 uccessful formula was found\, it didn’t take long until he’d open for 
 artists such as Nathaniel Rateliff\, David Ramirez\, Todd Day Wait\, John 
 Butler\, Riley Downing (The Deslondes)\, Clem Snide and Kenny Loggins\, to
  name a few.\n\nNow residing in San Diego\, byway of a ten-year Naval care
 er\, Alex has made his mark within that scene. In 2023\, he earned a nomin
 ation from the San Diego Music Awards for ‘Best Folk/Acoustic Album’ w
 ith nods to his EP\, My Notebook. In 2024\, Alex put another notch in the 
 belt with a San Diego Music Award win for his acclaimed single\, Unpromise
 d Land. He just landed a 2025 SDMA win for his tune\, Ghost in the Addict.
  Alex has also been nominated in San Diego Magazine’s “2025 People of 
 the Year” for Best Singer / Songwriter and Best Male Vocalist. \nAlex’
 s debut album\, “Undercover” is out now and features a wide array of f
 riends and guest singers. Among that list are David Ramirez\, Francis Blum
 e\, Ash Easton and Justin John Rodriguez. \n\nGARRETT OWEN BIO: \n\n“He
 ’s got the kind of stories worthy of a best-selling memoir – and when 
 your ears latch onto Garrett Owen‘s “Sad Eyed Son” for the first tim
 e\, you’ll notice a definite difference\, right off the bat. Garrett Owe
 n is the consummate artist – a poet’s poet and a player with a style a
 ll his own. His love-at-first-listen new record arrives in February – ea
 ch song conveying an astute wisdom and vision beyond his years.”  -Glid
 e Magazine – “Owen often turns to sadder subject matter for his songs.
  But though there is melancholy laced throughout much of his songwriting\,
  there is also something sweet and comforting about Owen’s voice that le
 ts you know things just may work out alright. The ability to strike this b
 alance is front and center on Owen’s new EP Sad Eyed Son. The album find
 s Owen embracing the rich tradition of Texas songwriters while forging his
  own path with poignant emotional narratives.” – KKXT “He’s an agi
 le\, intricate\, accomplished guitar player who sings honey-dipped melodie
 s about devastating turns of events. His pain soothes listeners\, his perf
 ormances leave audiences paralyzed.”  -Dallas Observer

 ober 16th\, 2025\n \nDoors 7PM\nShow 8PM\n\nAbout Dizgo:WEBSITE | INSTA
 GRAM | LISTEN\nBorn from attic jam sessions between childhood friends An
 drew Pickel and Kevin Hinnefeld\, Dizgo’s story began with two guitars\,
  a tape recorder\, and a dream-literally. The band’s name came to Hinnef
 eld in a dream\, before their first gig\, reflecting the cosmic\, boundary
 -breaking sound they’d soon deliver. Later joined by Jake Evatt on keys/
 vocals and Justin Clark on drums\, the Bloomington-based quartet has since
  evolved into one of the country’s premiere touring acts.Critics have ca
 lled Dizgo “one of the most operative names in the jam band scene” and
 “Indiana’s psychedelic powerhouse\,” blending the adventurous spirit
  of jamtronica with the deep-pocket pulse of funk\, the warmth of soul\, e
 xplosive guitar\, and the kaleidoscopic textures of psychedelic rock.Their
  live shows are immersive journeys-a dance party and mind-trip rolled into
  one. Interweaving soulful vocals\, analog synths\, and searing guitar com
 plete with intricate compositions and extended improvisation. The result i
 s something both danceable and introspective: a dance floor where heads an
 d hearts move in equal measure. (READ MORE HERE)\nAbout Squeaky Feet:WEBSI
 TE | INSTAGRAM | LISTEN\nSqueaky Feet is redefining the prog rock & ja
 m-band experience with their electrifying blend of progressive rock\, jazz
  fusion\, and dance grooves. Combining inspiration from giants such as Kin
 g Crimson\, Weather Report\, Pink Floyd\, Steely Dan\, and Rush with the m
 odern improvisational ethos of Phish\, Umphrey’s McGee\, and Dopapod\, t
 he Denver-based quintet captivates audiences with high-energy performances
  that transcend genre boundaries. Seamlessly weaving triumphant solos\, in
 tricate rhythms\, and exploratory improvisation\, Squeaky Feet delivers a 
 sonic journey that leaves listeners enthralled and live audiences in awe.\
 nFounded in 2019 by Berklee College of Music alumni\, Squeaky Feet has rap
 idly built a devoted fanbase\, thanks to their unparalleled musicianship a
 nd innovative approach to live performances. The band’s lineup—Colin S
 hore (guitar/vocals)\, Greg King (guitar)\, Jimmy Finnegan (bass/vocals)\,
  Brian Keller (keyboards/sax/flute/vocals)\, and Kevin D’Angelo (drums)
 —showcases a collective virtuosity that sets them apart in the jam scene
 . Their 2023 debut studio album\, Cause for Alarm\, solidifies their place
  as a force to be reckoned with. An 80-minute odyssey of progressive rock 
 and jazz fusion\, the album features bold improvisation and contributions 
 from renowned guitarist Mark Lettieri on the lead single\, “Tunnel Visio
 n.” (READ MORE HERE)\n

 . Matheny has been making music since 1998\, often under the name Emperor 
 X. A former STEM educator and physics graduate student\, Matheny paused ac
 ademic work and spent much of the past two decades crossing the world on b
 uses and bullet trains to perform hundreds of concerts or compose in situ 
 at locations ranging from a symphony hall in Portugal to the basement of a
  garden supply shop in Pittsburgh to an abandoned trade fair dome in north
 ern Lebanon. He often tours alone with a guitar and synth\, but sometime s
 hares bills with fellow travelers including The Hotelier\, The World is a 
 Beautiful Place and I Am No Longer Afraid to Die\, and most recently AJJ a
 nd Xiu Xiu. To date he has released ten albums and more than a dozen odd-f
 ormat tour-only EPs and one-off singles. Music from some of these recordin
 gs appears in the soundtrack of the of the 2014 Warner Bros. film Veronica
  Mars and has been featured on national radio outlets including Rundfunk B
 erlin-Brandenburg in Germany and National Public Radio (three times) in th
 e United States.  He co-produced the Sub Pop album Bits by jangle punk leg
 ends Oxford Collapse alongside Eric Topalski of Don Caballero and Storm & 
 Stress. He has composed video soundtrack music for labor unions and non-pr
 ofit organizations including Planned Parenthood and SEIU. In 2011 and 2012
 \, Matheny’s ambient work Keeling Curve was used in a multimedia install
 ation by photographer Joel Sternfeld that was featured in a retrospective 
 exhibition at Museum Folkwang. In addition to his nascent cooperative labe
 l project Dreams of Field Recordings with The Hotelier’s Christian Holde
 n\, he has worked with several labels including Burnt Toast Vinyl\, Tiny E
 ngines\, and Bar/None Records.  Matheny is a resident of Brieskow-Finkenhe

 rbird Music Hall4053 Butler Street\, Pittsburgh\, PADoors @ 7pmShow @ 8pmA
 GE RESTRICTION: 21+Ferdinand The Bull crafts sweeping indie folk built on 
 a foundation of eloquent melodicism and the sweetest of vocal harmonies. A
 t turns intimate and grand\, imbued with a inner warmth\, Something Into N
 othing is a comfortable\, burnished jewel-box of a record\, as easy as a s
 ummer evening. Beautifully wrought and soft as worn denim\, it stands read
 y to soundtrack your most wonderfully destination-free backroads rambles. 
 Something Into Nothing also marks a new chapter in the musical journey of 
 songwriter Nick Snyder\; the realization\, that at its core\, this is trul
 y his ship to captain. “Working on these songs mostly alone led me to th
 e realization that it was time to rely more on myself\, instead of looking
  for the approval and input from others” explains Snyder. “Ferdinand t
 he Bull has always been my creative and emotional outlet\, but to me life 
 is about collaborating and doing things together. At one point\, we counte
 d my friends who were at one point in this band and played at least a live
  show or two\, and we quickly ran out of fingers – and toes!”\nRecorde
 d alongside the old plaster and new tile\, Something Into Nothing is both 
 a celebration of the journey Snyder has taken with Ferdinand the Bull and 
 a return to his roots. These are songs written over the years – he began
  writing “Someday\, Someday” at nineteen and only just recently finish
 ed it\, while “Texas Cigarette” is a much more contemporary creation. 
 The first room to see the hammer was\, unsurprisingly\, the home studio. 
 “It really made me feel so young and creative again\, and I’m so excit
 ed for the future and everything to come\,” tells Snyder. “I’ve been
  playing these songs live for years\, and I needed to get them out for eve
 ryone to hear.”\nRecorded with friend and producer Dylan Mckinstry of th
 e band Upstate\, bassist Jon Leff\, and drummer Dan Leon\, Something Into 
 Nothing\, is at once a nod to the past and a promise of things to come. It
  is a testament to the idea that sometimes the only way to gain control is
  to let things go. “Fighting the current can be why you’re stuck in pl
 ace\, instead of moving forward the way you’re supposed to go. Just like
  a leaf in a river. It might sound contradictory\, but contradiction is a 
 big part of being human.”Based in Pittsburgh\, Pennsylvania\, the Ferdin
 and the Bull delivers the spirit of the Appalachian highlands to venues an
 d festivals thousands of miles away\, including an official showcase at SX
 SW in 2022\, and sharing stages alongside powerhouse artists such as Charl
 es Wesley Godwin\, Josh Ritter\, Dustbowl Revival\, Mo Lowda and the Humbl
 e\, and the Ghost of Paul Revere.Ticket Tier Info:General Admission Ticket

  \nHailing from a quaint town in Co. Cork\, Ireland\, Darren Kiely’s fo
 lk-infused pop sound originates from his inherited love of traditional Iri
 sh music\, intertwined with modern influences such as The Lumineers\, Mumf
 ord & Sons\, and Noah Kahan. At just five years old\, Darren learned the t
 in whistle\, and at eight years old he picked up the fiddle\, eventually t
 eaching himself to play guitar as well. Darren began singing in 2019\, qui
 ckly garnering attention for his raw and fervent vocals and emotive delive
 ry. After winning numerous honors at a national level in Irish traditional
  music\, Darren found his way to NYC in 2022 to continue developing his ow
 n music and sound\, and soon after headed to the songwriting hub of Nashvi
 lle. Darren’s unique presentation of folk-infused pop and lush storytell
 ing\, which echoes the backdrop of the Irish countryside where he was rais
 ed\, is the forefront of his debut EP\, Lost\, which arrived last fall. Lo
 st features new track “Mom & Dad\,” which debuted in the Top 40 on the
  Irish Singles Chart and also landed him in the Top 5 on the Irish Homegro
 wn chart\, as well as fan-favorite\, No. 1 hit\, “Sunrise.” Kiely took
  his new music on the road in the fall with his headline THE ROAD HOME TOU
 R\, where he sold out shows across his home country of Ireland. The singer
  is currently on his international headline tour\, THE LOST TOUR.\nTicket

 oors @ 7pmShow @ 8pmAGE RESTRICTION: 18+ or with legal guardian\n \n\nGeo
 rdie’s debut solo album boasts a brand of high quality\, all-embracing a
 lternative pop fun not heard in a very long time\, walking the line betwee
 n the ridiculous and brilliant with a teflon-coated aplomb.\nHow the recor
 d came about is a thing to marvel at. Over thirty session musicians were i
 nvolved in its making\, on two continents. Greep says\, “Half of the tra
 cks were done in Brazil\, with local musicians pulled together at the last
  minute. They’d never heard anything I’d done before\, they were just 
 interested in the demos I’d made. The tracking was all done in one\, may
 be two days.”\nThe spirit of Greep’s increasingly febrile and furtive 
 soliloquies simultaneously calls to mind both Frank Zappa and Frank Sinatr
 a\, with a healthy dash of Scott Walker sprinkled throughout.The instrumen
 tal title track is a jazz-funk workout that could double as a soundtrack f
 or a TV series or the intro music for a Broadway musical. Brass\, wah-wah 
 pedal and bass stabs\, choruses and polyrhythms\, all fizz and tumble arou
 nd the place creating a sense of excitement and expectation. Tracks often 
 oscillate from whispers to shouts\, and start and end on a bang.\nThe stor
 ies themselves act as a shopping list of the Active Male Imagination. A se
 ries of vignettes\, where Geordie Greep plays the role of emcee and conduc
 tor. The characters we hear from are engaged in wild fantasies and situati
 ons in which they inevitably falter. “The main theme of the record is de
 speration\; someone who is kidding themselves that they have everything un
 der control\, but they don’t.” Here Greep gives color to a set of imag
 inings which include cannibalism\, being boiled alive\, and a woman giving
  birth to a goat.\nStreet life is all around The New Sound: the listener i
 s thrown into a world of cafes\, bars\, rented rooms\, cabarets and strang
 e museums. Here we see our heroes carry out a series of naughty assignment
 s\, military cosplay or socio-economic triumphs. The lines between parody 
 and sermon are often blurred. The urbane romantic fantasy of single ‘Hol
 y Holy’ tells the story of an imaginary liaison in a nightclub\, soundtr
 acked by ’noughties indie chords and bravura Latin big band arrangements
  – including a three-piano attack.\nWhat next?“My plan is to ‘do a K
 eith Jarrett thing’\, have a different group of session musicians in a d
 ifferent place and lean into the fact that we’re not going to get it the
  same.”\nHow can anything ever be ‘the same’ with Greep at the helm?

 Butler Street\, Pittsburgh\, PADoors @ 7pmShow @ 8pmAGE RESTRICTION: 18+ o
 r with legal guardian\nFolksinger Willi Carlisle holds tight the convictio
 n that love is bigger than hate\, and no-one is expendable. Carlisle’s m
 usic has always been a dance between absurdity\, spectacle\, and philosoph
 y. On his fourth studio album\, Winged Victory\, Carlisle returns with his
  signature blend of traditionally-rooted folk music and kaleidoscope of od
 dball characters to confer with his core tenets in more overt and provocat
 ive ways. \nCarlisle delivers Victory as the next chapter in his long-runn
 ing direct address to the hope that by understanding our collective suffer
 ing we might be free of it. The idea began with 2022’s Peculiar\, Missou
 ri when Carlisle proclaimed “your heart’s a big tent\, everybody gets 
 in.” After gathering together all the world’s weirdos and misfits unde
 r the big tent\, with 2024’s Critterland\, Carlisle let them loose into 
 the world. Now\, on Winged Victory\, they speak for themselves\, unencumbe
 red by social expectations.  \nVictory\, Carlisle’s first self-produce
 d album\, will be released June 27 via Signature Sounds.  Though occasio
 nally raunchy\, and routinely provocative\, Victory is not afraid to make 
 a spectacle for the sake of a point. Victory should be understood as a ref
 lection. It revels in the beauty of tiny\, monetarily-worthless moments an
 d things\, offering with them a consideration of our innate humanity. \n\

 s @ 7pmShow @ 8pmAGE RESTRICTION: 18+ or with legal guardian\nWith a sound
  that blends the best of the past and present\, Zinadelphia crafts timeles
 s\, colorful songs that play the long game.\nFollowing a successful trio o
 f singles\, Zinadelphia released her debut Lucky EP in 2023\, and began to
 uring as support for artists who are equally as audacious: Medium Build\, 
 Teddy Swims and most recently\, Tori Kelly. “It’s the most fun I’ve 
 had in my whole life\,” she describes. She built her audience organicall
 y\, performing cross-country for the first time and captivating new fans w
 ith her singular voice and charm.\nEntering 2024\, Zinadelphia brought tog
 ether writer-producers Leroy Clampitt and Gabe Goodman\, working out of LA
  together to create a sound that is everything she’s always wanted. “I
 ’m very much a maximalist\,” she explains. “I wanted to dip into an 
 old Hollywood feel\, almost Burlesque-like.” This aesthetic\, combined w
 ith her love of 60s and 70s icons like The Supremes\, Gloria Gaynor\, and 
 Tammi Terrell\, birthed songs that feel reminiscent of those decades\, whi
 le still being grounded in the present. Her next single\, “Love Over Glo
 ry\,” encapsulates the power that Zinadelphia has always possessed\, now
  on full display. She strives to be realistic\, rather than aspirational\,
  about her struggles\, contrasting darker themes with high energy tempos. 
 Referencing disco motifs with bombastic horns\, funk basslines and a four-
 on-the-floor beat\, the single sets the stage for a new era to come: “It
 ’s the most me I’ve ever felt.”\nZinadelphia embraces life’s “ug
 ly truths” through her songwriting\, using music as an outlet to process
  new experiences and express herself. She captures the highs and lows of w
 omanhood\, marrying vintage aesthetics with a fresh and exciting perspecti
 ve.\n \n\n \nTicket Tier Info:General Admission Tickets – Standing Roo

 S featuring some of the most interesting academics in the city presenting 
 their work in a good old fashion dive bar.  Our second lineup covers every
 thing from Clueless to Galileo - we'll be answering your questions about t
 he vastness of the universe\, and shine an academic light on one of cinema
 's most juvenile genre's!  Carles Badenes - Pitt Professor "How Big is the
  Universe? A Historical Perspective" A historical overview of how humankin
 d has tried to tackle this very big question\, from the first attempts to 
 the modern version of the answer (warning: this is incredibly broad and in
 sanely ambitious)  Jacqueline Johnson - Pitt Professor "Teen Film" This co
 urse will look at a type of film that has been prominent in Hollywood and 
 international cinema since 1955: the youth film or teen film or teenpic. T
 he teenpic has been variously defined as films targeted at a teenage marke
 t and as films about teenagers (and sometimes both). In considering the te
 enpic as a genre\, we will attempt to break it down into subgenres such as
  the juvenile delinquent film\, the teen musical\, the teen horror film\, 
 nostalgic teen films\, postmodern youth cult films\, African American teen
  films\, “girl” teenpics\, and LGBTQIA+ teenpics.  And open Q&As with 
 both after!  PLUS! 100% of the ticket sales from this event will be donate

DESCRIPTION:https://www.poetrymillvale.com/event/kissthetiger/\nAt a time w
 hen the world seems intent on pushing us further inward and further apart\
 , Kiss the Tiger are here to rattle our bones and bust us out of our cocoo
 ns with some good old fashioned rock and roll. \nFronted by the magnetic a
 nd disarming Meghan Kreidler\, who draws on her background in theater to b
 reak the fourth wall between audience and band with her righteous fist pum
 ps and high kicks\, this is a band that doesn’t just play. They combust.
  And watching them set the stage ablaze\, it’s hard not to feel that ten
 sion that’s been built up in all of us these past few years slowly relea
 se\, too\, like a collective exhale set to ratcheting guitars\, buoyant ba
 ss lines and Kreidler’s perfectly pitched screams. Theirs is a clean-bur
 ning fire. Hell\, you might even call it healing. \n“We want to give the
  audience an experience that is visceral and jolts them awake—creating c
 ommunity in that moment\,” Kreidler notes. “I think that’s a really 
 nice gift you can give people: Just let go.” \nOver the past few years K
 iss the Tiger have set the Twin Cities ablaze\, and there’s nary a club\
 , block party\, park amphitheater or backyard that they haven’t transfor
 med with their commanding live shows. And their rigorous performance sched
 ule has paid off: The band has never sounded tighter or more certain of it
 s mission. Kreidler is backed on stage by her longtime partner and creativ
 e foil\, Michael Anderson\, on rhythm guitar\, plus lead guitarist Alex Sa
 ndberg\, bassist Paul DeLong\, and drummer Alyse Emanuel. \nTheir sets are
  often accompanied by sing-alongs to regional hits like the hard-knocking 
 “Motel Room\,” their ode to pandemic loneliness\, “I Miss You\,” o
 r their pleading anthem “Hold On to Love\,” all of which have become i
 nstantly recognizable to locals thanks to regular airplay on the tastemaki
 ng public radio station 89.3 The Current. (“Hold On to Love\,” specifi
 cally\, spent a whopping nine weeks at No. 1 on The Current’s Chart Show
  and was inducted into the Chart Show Hall of Fame.) \nTheir latest album\
 , Vicious Kid\, is a tour de force through the band’s increasingly sophi
 sticated songwriting\, which is handled jointly by Kreidler and Anderson. 
 There are plenty of moments where they embody the spirit of late ‘70s ne
 w wave punk\, like in the ridiculously fun “Who Does Her Hair?” But th
 ey have started weaving in softer textures\, too\, like the crooning and f
 eminist alt-country ballad “Grown Ass Woman” or the skeletal and simme
 ring “Out of My Mind.” Unsurprisingly\, Vicious Kid was named one of t
 he Best Minnesota Albums of 2021 by the Minneapolis Star Tribune and highl
 ighted as their longtime critic Chris Riemenschneider’s personal favorit
 e that year. \nIn addition to exploring a wider variety of sounds and genr
 es\, Vicious Kid also features some of Kiss the Tiger’s most thought-pro
 voking lyrics to date. In “Grown Ass Woman\,” Kreidler pleads\, and th
 en demands\, that she be allowed to cut her own path in this world—a mes
 sage that dovetails seamlessly with Kiss the Tiger’s approach to making 
 music. “The angel of death wants me to draw another breath/But angel won
 ’t you leave me alone\,” she sings and sighs. “Even near the end not
  a foe or a friend/Is gonna tell me what to do.” \nIn addition to headli
 ning their own barn-burning shows\, Kiss the Tiger have also been tapped t
 o open for prominent acts such as Joan Jett\, Lucinda Williams\, Lake Stre
 et Dive\, The Suburbs\, The Hold Steady\, Golden Smog\, Gary Clark Jr.\, a
 nd the Cold War Kids. They have also brought their act on the road to open
  for Philly’s Low Cut Connie\, Austin’s Emily Wolfe\, and fellow Minne
 apolis indie favorites Bad Bad Hats. -Andrea Swensson

 s-to-the-sand-book-release/\nJ. Ale Hakala is a poet and visual artist who
  uses language\, photography\, and tracing to explore human experience\, e
 xistence\, and connection to nature and history. She is formally trained a
 nd practices as a geoscientist\, rides a snowboard\, and lives with her fa
 mily in Pittsburgh’s South Hills. Her poetry and art appeared previously
  in yawp Art+ Literary ‘Zine (Poetry Lounge Press\, 2024-2025)\, and the
  Pittsburgh Poetry Collective 2025 Chapbook\, with additional creative wor
 ks published on Instagram @daybreakcarve and daybreakcarve.org. \nFrom Mou
 ntains to the Sand is a collection of poems written by Ale over the past 2
 5 years and represents her pursuit to understand the concept of “place
 ” in the context of location and connection\, as a result from frequent 
 relocations during childhood\, travel during training in science and board
 ercross\, and the wild ride of growing a family. More recent experiences i
 n Ale’s travel across the United States led to the development of new fr
 iendships\, processing of evolving relationships with family (including he
 r husband and children)\, and the unexpected wrestling through unresolved 
 history. This collection is the result of a journey across growth and eros
 ion and questioning what it means to exist and to love\, with the ferocity
  of nature that enables the growth of mountains and their weathering into 
 sand. \n

DESCRIPTION:https://www.poetrymillvale.com/event/caitlin-cannon/\nCAITLIN C
 ANNON – LOVE ADDICT LP \nCaitlin Cannon’s upcoming album\, Love Addict
 \, is a bold\, genre-defying body of work produced by Misa Arriaga (Kacey 
 Musgraves\, Willie Nelson). Blending dreamy Americana with classic country
 \, the 10-track record swirls with intergalactic pedal steel\, gritty groo
 ves\, and raw\, unguarded lyrics. Recorded live\, the album captures the s
 pontaneity of guitars bleeding into keys\, drums\, strings\, and more\, cr
 eating a sound that feels both timeless and fresh. Think “cosmicana”
 —a sonic landscape as deep and evocative as Cannon’s storytelling. \nC
 annon’s songwriting expertly balances humor and vulnerability\, satire a
 nd sincerity. Her 2024 EP\, Beggar\, earned acclaim for tracks like “Ama
 rillo and Little Rock” and “Waiting\,” a deeply moving song that cen
 ters on her brother’s 35-year to date incarceration\, which also reappea
 rs on Love Addict in demo form. If Beggar was the prelude\, Love Addict is
  the crescendo—fully realized and unapologetic in its arrival. \nCritics
  have taken notice. Saving Country Music has called her “a songwriter fo
 r the broken\, the downtrodden\, the losers…She sings about real sh— t
 hat most other songwriters don’t have the guts to broach.” Early prais
 e for Love Addict from Country Music People hails it as “an Americana tr
 iumph\, packed with edgy irreverence\, wit\, and sharp\, cutting lyrics we
  first encountered on her debut\, The TrashCannon Album.” While arguably
  more ‘vibey’ than some of Cannon’s earlier work\, Love Addict still
  delivers her signature sneak attacks with a wink on songs like “Dr. Dea
 ler” and “Jesus Is My Lover.” In the album’s title track\, she dee
 ms it a “science lesson” when she sings\, “I know you’re lying whe
 n you say that stuff\, I just got excited you could get it up\,” calling
  out the unfairness of a woman’s seeming genetic predisposition to fall 
 in love after every intimate act. \nOther introspective moments on Love Ad
 dict explore themes of loss\, addiction\, and self-worth. Songs like “Le
 t It Hurt Some” (co-written with Misa Arriaga) and “My Own Company” 
 (a collaboration with renowned crooner Kiely Connell) channel the authenti
 c country sound of 60s and 70s Nashville. Tender tracks like “I Wouldn
 ’t Say I Love You” and “The Impact” reveal Cannon’s gift for cra
 fting fresh\, emotionally resonant narratives that linger long after the m
 usic ends. \nBeyond music\, Cannon is a force of creative energy. From her
  comedic debut on Kill Tony to teaching songwriting to inmates through her
  Beyond Bars program\, she defies easy categorization. Beyond Bars\, devel
 oped in collaboration with The Cultural Arts Alliance and The 30A Songwrit
 ers Festival\, has been featured on Meg Ryan’s series Empowered\, highli
 ghting her commitment to bridging art and social impact.

 \n  MILITARIE GUN with support from LIQUID MIKE PUBLIC OPINION  $20 ADV / 
 $25 DOS 7PM DOORS / 8PM MUSIC ALL AGES  for fans of... Turnstile\, Drug Ch
 urch\, Touché Amoré  BIO: Militarie Gun are a truly uncategorizable band
 . Led by vocalist Ian Shelton\, the band’s debut full-length\, Life Unde
 r The Gun\, is almost impossible to describe without bouncing between cont
 radictions. Is it abnormally aggressive pop music or is it unusually catch
 y hardcore? Is it deeply intellectual or is it satisfyingly primal? Is it 
 a vulnerable attempt to unpack lifelong cycles of hurt\, or is it a collec
 tion of world-beating\, absurdist punk anthems? In the end\, the answer is
  obvious: it’s all of it. It’s Militarie Gun.  Since forming in 2020\,
  the group have been releasing music and touring at a startling rate\, and
  while Life Under The Gun feels like a culmination of this recent hard-ear
 ned momentum\, the record is inextricably linked to Shelton’s past. “I
  grew up in a household with family members struggling with addiction\,”
  he explains. “It was an oppressive force. We were always wondering\, 
 ‘Is it going to be a good day or a bad day? Are the cops going to come t
 oday? What am I going to come home to after school?’ You could only esca
 pe it for so many hours at a time.” The challenges of his homelife were 
 only exacerbated by living in Enumclaw\, WA\, a sparsely populated rural s
 uburb where Shelton spent his formative years longing for a way out. In th
 is difficult and stifling environment\, the roots of Life Under The Gun be
 gan to grow. As he began to pick up instruments\, play in bands\, and writ
 e his own songs\, music quickly became a vital outlet for self-expression\
 , but Shelton couldn’t shake the idea that it was also a literal escape 
 route.  And he was right. After high school\, Shelton bounced around the P
 acific Northwest before eventually landing in Seattle\, where he founded t
 he pummeling hardcore outfit\, Regional Justice Center. The band released 
 two critically acclaimed full-lengths\, toured around the world\, and bega
 n allowing Shelton to live some of the things he’d set his sights on as 
 a child. Parallel to these musical successes\, he was also pursuing his ot
 her love: film. While in Seattle\, Shelton began directing music videos fo
 r his bands and soon had credits under his belt for other artists like Ang
 el Du$t\, Drug Church\, Supercrush\, and more. The directing was going so 
 well that he moved to Los Angeles with plans to put music on the backburne
 r to pursue filmmaking full-time. “Then in 2020 everything got derailed\
 ,” he says. “I felt like I was heading into the final year of RJC and 
 then I was going to move on from music\, but when everything shut down tha
 t just left me with my most immediate interest\, which was songwriting.”
   What followed was a flurry of activity that still hasn’t let up. Shelt
 on’s restless creative drive took over and he spontaneously wrote the fi
 rst songs that became Militarie Gun\, which were followed by more songs…
 and then more and more. The sound was decidedly new for him: still firmly 
 rooted in punk and hardcore but more hook-driven\, pulling from influences
  like Guided By Voices\, Fugazi\, or The Jesus Lizard. Shelton quickly rec
 orded Militarie Gun’s 2020 debut EP\, My Life Is Over\, by himself\, the
 n rounded out the lineup with guitarists Nick Cogan and William Acuña\, a
 nd drummer Vince Nguyen (Max Epstein played bass on Life Under The Gun). 2
 021 saw the release of the dual All Roads Lead To The Gun EPs and the star
 t of a seemingly endless run of tour dates. Then in 2022\, Militarie Gun t
 eamed with Dazy for the wildly received collaborative single “Pressure C
 ooker\,” which was soon followed by the band signing to Loma Vista Recor
 dings and releasing a deluxe edition of the All Roads Lead To The Gun EPs 
 that included even more new material. All of this along with Shelton’s p
 roduction work and guest appearances with groups like MSPAINT\, Public Opi
 nion\, and Cold Mega.  Militarie Gun soon had the makings of Life Under Th
 e Gun: the kind of debut album that feels like a true arrival\, one forged
  by a lifetime of experience and effort that’s now allowed an artist to 
 fully come into their own. Engineered by Taylor Young at The Pit Recording
  Studio\, the album’s 12 tracks take all of the best parts of Militarie 
 Gun’s earlier work and amps them up to the highest possible degree. It s
 ounds massive without sacrificing the punk spark–full of driving drums\,
  distorted bass lines\, and of course Shelton’s instantly recognizable r
 oar–only this time everything is bigger and even catchier. “This is wh
 at I thought we sounded like all along\,” Shelton laughs. “It’s alwa
 ys felt like a melody-forward band to me\, but I think now we’re finally
  achieving what I was always setting out to do.”  The clarity of his sin
 gular vision is palpable in each song’s deft blend of aggression and acc
 essibility\, but Shelton also cites collaboration as essential to his proc
 ess–whether with his band members or outside sources like Young and Jame
 s Goodson of Dazy\, who sings harmonies on much of the album. In the end\,
  it’s no surprise that his lifelong desire to find connection through ar
 t has manifested in the direction of his own music. “A huge part of it i
 s just about sharing your energy with other people\,” Shelton says. “S
 ometimes with punk that’s coming from anger\, but it’s exciting to do 
 that with the melodic side as well\, to take something that’s stuck in y
 our head and try to make it stuck in someone else’s\, too.”  Life Unde
 r The Gun opens with the razor sharp guitars and tremendous chorus of the 
 ADHD anthem “Do It Faster\,” making it clear that Militarie Gun haven
 ’t just embraced melody\, they excel at it. The song’s impatient lyric
 s capture Shelton’s hyperactive creativity and echo all the way back to 
 his youth spent imagining the life he now leads. “Very High” follows a
 nd somehow offers an even bigger chorus\, while continuing to draw his pas
 t and present together in a way that feels both critical and empathetic. 
 “It’s just about addiction\,” Shelton says. “It’s about feeling 
 bad and reaching for something to change that. I started exploring drugs a
 s an adult and it made me look back on my childhood in a different way.”
  On tracks like “Will Logic\,” “Return Policy\,” and “Think Less
 \,” he interrogates interpersonal relationships through this distinctly 
 blunt and self-aware lens\, dipping into spite or anger only to turn the b
 lame back on himself again.  On “Never Fucked Up Once\,” Shelton demon
 strates this willingness to approach the third rail\, juxtaposing some of 
 the album’s most darkly comedic lyrics with its most overt pop-rock sens
 ibilities. Much of Life Under The Gun feels informed by this need for huma
 n connection\, but also the messiness that often comes with it. “Sway To
 o” and “See You Around” showcase Militarie Gun pushing themselves to
  be as tuneful as possible\, especially on the latter’s mellotron-led ba
 lladry\, but they also pose some of the album’s most difficult questions
  about what happens when we hurt one another. “It would be easy to avoid
  talking about how I’ve been hurt or how I’ve hurt other people\,” S
 helton explains\, “but I think it’s important to make something that
 ’s true and has teeth. Sometimes when you feel so aggressively against s
 omething\, you need to stop and wonder if it might apply to you.”  Life 
 Under The Gun closes with its title track\, two minutes and 46 seconds of 
 widescreen punk that pivots from pounding aggression to a triumphant clima
 x of windmill-able guitars and layered harmonies. Shelton sings the final 
 refrain “a life of pursuit ends up pursuing you” like an urgent remind
 er to himself: move forward or get swallowed up–your past might shape yo
 u\, but it doesn’t have to define you. “I think the best case scenario
  is you learn from the things you’ve been through instead of continuing 
 that cycle\,” he says. The song’s final lone chord rings out like a qu
 estion\, asking if the listener is ready for the changes ahead. It’s a f
 ittingly hopeful-yet-ambiguous ending for the debut album from a band that
 ’s already come so far and evolved so much–but whose story has only ju
 st begun.

 25-584441\n  Langston Kerman is an LA based comedian\, actor\, writer\, an
 d producer. Langston can be seen starring in Bust Down (Peacock)\, a serie
 s that he also Executive Produced/Co-Created with Sam Jay\, Chris Redd and
  Jak Knight. He was a writer for Everybody's Live with John Mulaney\, and 
 has appeared on The English Teacher and Abbott Elementary.  Why'd We Book 
 It? Langston is a comics comic - according to a Vulture interview John Mul
 aney\, upon seeing Langston's hour in person\, was "so impressed by its st
 rength that he felt inspired to take on the challenge of directing a stand
 -up special for the first time. 'The reason to film it was because it was 
 so good\,' says Mulaney."  And that's exactly what he did\, directing and 
 producing Langston's Netflix debut Bad Poetry\, before bringing him onboar
 d the Everybody's Live writing staff this spring.  He's got a background i
 n poetry (as discussed in that special)\, and you can feel it in the rythm
 ns and the cadeance. His stuff is smart\, but never naval gazing\, biting 
 but never mean spirited\, and above all - never lazy. Langston has already
  been to Bottlerocket with his podcast My Momma Told Me\, but we're excite
 d to welcome him for his debut Bottlerocket hour!  For Fans Of... Sam Jay\
 , Roy Wood Jr.\, John Mulaney  Extended Bio: He is the head writer/one of 
 the Executive Producers of PAUSE with Sam Jay (HBO)\, which was nominated

  season. On screen Langston recurred as ‘Eagle The Archer’ in the seco
 nd season of The Boys (Amazon). His other acting credits include starring 
 alongside Lake Bell and Dax Shepard as ‘Brandon’ on the Bless This Mes
 s (ABC) and recurring as ‘Jared’ on Insecure (HBO). He will next be se
 en recurring opposite Gina Rodriguez in Not Dead Yet (ABC) and recurring a
 s ‘Jesse’ in the highly anticipated The Other Black Girl (Hulu/Onyx). 
 Langston wrote for 2 seasons of South Side (HBO Max) and he recurs on the

 but Gerard Way would later say “Really\, it's about two boys living in N

 son-quintet/\nPaul Thompson\, John Shannon\, Dan Wilson\, Glenn Zaleski\, 
 and David Throckmorton come together in a bursting-at-the-seams-with-talen
 t quintet to pay well-deserved tribute to legendary guitarist Pat Metheny.
 Pat Metheny is one of the most acclaimed jazz musicians playing today. He 
 reinvented the traditional jazz guitar sound with his first album\, Bright
  Size Life (1975)\, and he has continued to redefine the genre by utilizin
 g new technology. Pat Metheny has won 20 Grammy Awards in a record-breakin
 g 12 different categories\, and he has spent most of his life on tour\, av
 eraging between 120 and 240 shows a year since 1974.Pat Metheny has been a
 n incredible influence and life-long inspiration for Paul Thompson. Paul g
 rew up on Metheny’s music\, and now Paul himself is one of the most esta
 blished jazz musicians in Pittsburgh today. This concert\, curated by Paul
  Thompson\, brings together three Pittsburgh-based musicians and two out-o
 f-town guests to honor this inspirational musician and push the limits of 
 what it means to be a jazz musician and a jazz guitarist. Featured Musici
 ans:Paul Thompson: bassJohn Shannon: guitarDan Wilson: guitarGlenn Zaleski
 : pianoDavid Throckmorton: drumsAbout the Artists:Paul Thompson has been p
 laying bass professionally for over 30 years\, including recording and tou
 ring stints with trumpeter Maynard Ferguson and saxophonist Stanley Turren
 tine. Recent playing credits include Hubert Laws\, Geri Allen\, Michael Fe
 instein\, and Bob James\, among others. Currently\, he can be seen playing
  around the Pittsburgh area with Salsamba!\, THOTH Trio\, the Pittsburgh J
 azz Orchestra\, in pit orchestras at the Byham and New Hazlett Theaters\, 
 or performing with some of our city’s rich jazz community. An active edu
 cator\, Paul currently teaches Jazz Bass at Duquesne University and West V
 irginia University. He is an Adjunct Instrumental Music teacher at his alm
 a mater\, Pittsburgh CAPA 6-12 Performing Arts School. John Shannon is a 
 visionary guitarist\, composer\, and sonic mystic whose music is a bridge 
 between worlds—earth and sky\, tradition and innovation\, the seen and t
 he unseen. Born in Pittsburgh\, PA\, John began playing guitar at the age 
 of six and soon found himself immersed in a lifelong path of musical and s
 piritual discovery. As a teenager\, he studied under local masters of vari
 ous instruments—bassist Dwayne Dolphin\, saxophonist Eric Kloss\, and pi
 pe organist Mike Ross—each deepening his awareness of tone\, space\, and
  the power of improvisation as a channel for transcendence. As a freelance
  musician in New York City\, John became a sought-after guitarist and coll
 aborator across genres\, performing with Hiromi\, Gary Go\, Karsh Kale\, B
 ob Reynolds\, Pyeng Threadgill\, and Tony Award-winner Norbert Leo Butz. R
 eturning to his roots in Pittsburgh in 2019\, John co-founded Con Alma—a
  jazz club and sanctuary for music\, food\, and drink alchemy—where he n
 ow serves as co-owner and music curator. Reconnected with the deep jazz li
 neage of his hometown\, he reignited his passion for straight-ahead jazz w
 hile continuing to compose original works steeped in beauty\, mysticism\, 
 and inner truth.David Throckmorton has performed all over the world with a
 rtists including Maynard Ferguson\, David Fiuczynski\, Tony Grey\, Hotei\,
  and Javon Jackson. David is one-third of DTC Organ Trio\, featuring guita
 rist Dan Wilson and organist Cliff Barnes. David leads or co-leads his own
  ensembles\, including Beam\, Thoth Trio\, Smash Your Wagon\, and The Davi
 d Throckmorton Quartet. David performs clinics and masterclasses worldwide
  and endorses Yamaha Drums\, Sabian Cymbals\, and Vic Firth Drumsticks.Dan
  Wilson grew up in Akron\, Ohio\, where he spent the majority of his youth
  within the church community\, where his musical path began. Traces of his
  major guitar influences—including Wes Montgomery\, Charlie Christian\, 
 Joe Pass\, and George Benson\, to name a few—can be discerned through hi
 s playing. Still\, his musical identity has been shaped by everything from
  gospel and blues to traditional jazz\, hip-hop\, and horn players like So
 nny Rollins and Joe Henderson. Dan’s career took him on an exploratory j
 ourney into foundations laid down by the guitar/organ tradition\, eventual
 ly leading to an invitation to perform with jazz great Joey DeFrancesco’
 s trio quartet\, with which Dan went on to earn a GRAMMY® Award nominatio
 n for DeFrancesco’s Project Freedom album (Mack Avenue Records\, 2017).G
 lenn Zaleski is one of the most in-demand pianists on the New York City ja
 zz scene. Originally from Boylston\, MA\, Glenn has made a name for himsel
 f playing with the likes of Ravi Coltrane\, Cécile McLorin Salvant\, the 
 Vanguard Jazz Orchestra\, Yotam Silberstein\, Ken Peplowski\, Lage Lund\, 
 Ari Hoenig\, and many more. His latest album\, Solo Vol. 2\, is a solo alb
 um of standards recorded during the pandemic\, and the second from his own
  label\, Stark Terrace Music. A new trio album\, Star Dreams\, is set for 
 release in August of 2024. Solo Vol. 1 was released in early 2018—his fi
 rst solo piano album\, as well as the first release from his own label. He
  has been described as “one of the most important pianists of his genera
 tion” by All About Jazz. In 2011\, Glenn was a semi-finalist in the Thel
 onious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition\, as well as a finalist f
 or the 2011 APA Cole Porter Fellowship in Jazz. He attended the Brubeck In
 stitute Fellowship program in Stockton\, CA\, from 2005 to 2007\, and then
  finished his undergraduate studies at The New School in 2009. From 2009 t
 o 2011\, while working towards his graduate degree at NYU\, Glenn was also
  on the NYU faculty\, teaching a variety of classes and private students.A

   SAINTSENECA with support from RADIATOR HOSPITAL (SOLO)  $17 ADV / $20 DO
 S 7PM DOORS / 8PM MUSIC ALL AGES  for fans of... Field Medic\, Hop Along\,
  Frog  BIO: Saintseneca’s Zac Little has been thinking a lot about memor
 y. Not necessarily his memories\, though they creep in often\, too. Rather
 \, he mulls over the idea of memory itself: its resilience\, its haziness\
 , how it slips away as we try to hang on\, the way it resurfaces despite o
 ur best efforts to forget.  Memory is the common thread running throughout
  the Columbus folk-punk band’s fourth album\, Pillar of Na\, arriving in
  late summer via ANTI- Records. Following 2015’s critically lauded Such 
 Things\, the new album’s name is rooted in remembrance\, referencing the
  Genesis story of Lot’s wife who looks back at a burning Sodom after God
  instructs her not to. She looks back\, and God turns her into a pillar of
  salt. “Na\,” meanwhile\, is the chemical symbol for sodium. “Nah”
  is a passive refusal and the universal song word. It means nothing and st
 ands for nothing. It is “as it is.”  Like Lot’s wife\, Little cannot
  help but revisit where—and how—he grew up. Raised in church in southe
 astern Appalachian Ohio\, he took up preaching when he was still a teenage
 r\, sometimes in small country settings and other times to congregations o
 f thousands. But these days he’s more interested in listening. And quest
 ioning.  Musically\, Pillar of Na is Saintseneca’s most ambitious album 
 to date\, with Little aiming to incorporate genre elements he’d rarely h
 eard in folk. “I wanted to use the idiom of folk-rock\, or whatever you 
 want to call it\, and to try to do something that had never been done befo
 re\,” Little explains. “To reach way back\, echoing ancient folk melod
 ies\, tie that into punk rock\, and then push it into the future. I told M
 ike Mogis I wanted Violent Femmes meets the new Blade Runner soundtrack. I
 ’m looking for the intersection between Kendrick Lamar and The Fairport 
 Convention.”  “You’re always going to be situated in the folk legacy
 \,” Little continues\, acknowledging his past recordings\, which include
  three albums (the aforementioned Such Things\, 2014’s Dark Arc\, 2011
 ’s Last) and three EPs (2016’s The Mallwalker\, 2010’s Grey Flag\, a
 nd 2009’s self-titled). “But let’s move forward. I’m not trying to
  make the lost Velvet Underground B-side. I want to find something that ha
 s never been heard before\, or at least go down trying.”

DESCRIPTION:https://mrsmalls.com/events/hunter-root/\nFew artists embody th
 e spirit of creative exploration as seamlessly as Pennsylvania-based multi
 -instrumentalist Hunter Root. His journey is a tale of passion and resilie
 nce\, and his success is a testament to his intuition and his unique music
 al vision. Raised in an environment steeped in classic rock\, Hunter's mus
 ical foundation was built alongside his older brother who introduced him t
 o guitar\, and opened his eyes to the power of songwriting. As a founding 
 member of the psychedelic rock outfit Medusa's Disco\, Hunter honed his sk
 ills on stage\, and gained invaluable insight into the labyrinthine workin
 gs of the music industry.\n\nEmbracing a genre-fluid approach\, Hunter's m
 usic weaves together elements of acoustic rock\, folk\, grunge\, and more.
  His approach to songwriting has evolved over the years\, shifting from a 
 lyric-centric process to a music-first methodology. This shift has allowed
  Hunter to match emotive soundscapes with the narrative potency of his son
 gs\, yielding compositions rich in both meaning and emotion. He employs a 
 similarly immersive approach to music production. He writes\, records\, mi
 xes\, and produces all his albums\, an uncompromising process that is both
  demanding and gratifying. \n\nHunter's personal experiences heavily influ
 ence his music. His acclaimed 2023 album\, 'Arkansas'\, was created as a t
 ribute following the passing of his older brother in 2020\, beautifully en
 capsulating his introspection. Despite calling Central Pennsylvania home\,
  the four years he spent in Arkansas during his youth had a profound impac
 t on his artistry. Consequently\, each song is a deeply personal narrative
 \, an homage to the sights\, sounds\, aches\, and scars found there. Hunte
 r's music achieved viral success through TikTok and Instagram\, where his 
 songs 'Town Rat Heathen' and 'Quicksand Sinking' struck a chord with users
  worldwide. He swiftly accumulated hundreds of thousands of followers acro
 ss both platforms\, inevitably driving traffic to Spotify\, where his sing
 les have garnered millions of plays. 2024 will see Hunter continue to buil
 d on his momentum\, as he plans an extensive series of tour dates accompan
 ied by his live band. For more information\, please visit www.hunterroot.c

 n  ADVANCE BASE with support tba  $15 ADV / $18 DOS 7PM DOORS / 8PM MUSIC 
 ALL AGES  for fans of... Frog\, Saintseneca\, Merce Lemon  ADVANCE BASE BI
 O: Advance Base is the melancholic soft rock recording project of Chicago\
 , IL singer/songwriter Owen Ashworth (formerly of Casiotone for the Painfu
 lly Alone). Using a two-handed arsenal of electric piano\, Omnichord\, sam
 plers\, effect pedals & drum machines\, Ashworth builds minimalist\, heavy
 -hearted\, & nostalgia-obsessed ballads around his conversational baritone
 . The warm\, electronic sound of Advance Base has been described as "lo-fi
 \," "depressed" & "weirdly uplifting."   Animal Companionship\, the third 
 & most recent "studio" album by Advance Base\, was released September 21\,
  2018 by Run For Cover Records / Orindal Records. GoldFlakePaint & Various
  Small Flames both listed Animal Companionship among their favorite albums
  of 2018. Since then\, Advance Base has released Wall of Tears & Other-Son
 gs I Didn't Write\, a home-recorded collection of (mostly) country/America
 na covers arranged for electronic instruments & Live at Home\, a collectio
 n of mid-quarantine livestream concert performances & the closest represen
 tation of an Advance Base live set commercially available. A new single ti
 tled ”Little Sable Point Lighthouse” was released on March 31\, 2022. 
   “It’s with no exaggeration we describe Owen Ashworth as one of the m
 ost consistent and important songwriters in contemporary indie music. From
  the earliest Casiotone For the Painfully Alone demos to most recent Advan
 ce Base single ‘Little Sable Point Lighthouse‘\, Owen has crafted a ca
 talogue of characters and circumstances with few rivals in the modern era.
  His is an ever evolving body of work which stands out in its deftness and
  humility and empathy and care\, bringing to life individuals from across 
 the spectrum of human experience while remaining unerringly attuned to the
  tender\, fallible heart at the centre of each.” - Various Small Flames

 oard the Everybody's Live writing staff this spring.  He's got a backgroun
 d in poetry (as discussed in that special)\, and you can feel it in the ry
 thmns and the cadeance. His stuff is smart\, but never naval gazing\, biti
 ng but never mean spirited\, and above all - never lazy. Langston has alre

DESCRIPTION:https://cityofasylum.org/program/writer-in-residence-olena-bory
 shpolets/\nIn this fresh and vibrant performance\, you will embark on a jo
 urney through a poem echoing Homer’s Odyssey and passing through the mod
 ern Ukrainian city of Odesa to the farthest corners of the earth. Enter th
 e world of Olena Boryshpolets’s New Calypso:Through the poetic tradition
  of rhyming comes a tale navigating wars\, the hypocrisy of politicians\, 
 and the destruction of the world by dictators. Traversing a land haunted b
 y a burning sea and a sky filled with missiles and drones\, a new\, modern
  heroine\, New Calypso\, makes her way. Just an ordinary woman to the untr
 ained eye\, her power lies in her persistence of self\, conducting her dia
 logue with the universe and the reality of today with an unshaking belief 
 in the power of love.  New Calypso’s story comes to life in this music
 al theater performance at Alphabet City\, featuring Olena Boryshpolets as 
 both author and actor\, actor Chris Rivas\, and bandura musician Lesya Ver
 ba. The performance will feature a folk song in the native language of And
 y Warhol’s mother\, Lemko Yulia Warhol.\nFor the uninitiated\, the bandu
 ra is a stringed and plucked Ukrainian folk instrument. A bandura player\,
  or “kobzar\,” is a Ukrainian folk singer and musician. They were the 
 creators\, keepers\, and transmitters of the epic tradition in the form of
  historical songs\, as well as fairy tales and legends\, accompanied by th
 e kobza\, lyre\, or bandura. Their significance for the Ukrainian people c
 an be compared to that of ancient Greek poets in ancient Greece and Arab p
 oets in Arabia.New Calypso was translated by Writer-in-Residence Oleksandr
  Frazé-Frazénko and published by Lefty Blondie Press\, a local indie pub
 lisher. All books are hand-trimmed\, hand-bound\, and hand-numbered. Copie
 s of New Calypso will be available for purchase at the program. This prog
 ram is made possible in part with the generous support of Irina and Daniel
  Peris\, the Paul D. Schurgot Foundation\, and The Bare Life Review\, a li
 terary organization supporting immigrant and asylum-seeking writers. The B
 are Life Review is a member of Intersection for the Arts\, a historic arts
  nonprofit organization that provides people working in arts and culture w
 ith fiscal sponsorship and resources to grow. About the Artist:Olena Borys
 hpolets is originally from Odesa\, Ukraine. They say you can leave Odesa\,
  but Odesa will never leave you. Thus\, Olena brought Odesa with her when 
 she came to Pittsburgh and is ready to share this incredible city with all
  of us. Olena is a poet\, writer\, journalist\, actress\, cultural manager
 \, and author of the short story book Ukrainian Detox and the book of poet
 ry Orpheus and Eurydice in New York. Olena is also a member of the Nationa
 l Union of Journalists of Ukraine\, a co-founder of the public organizatio
 n Creativity Without Borders\, and a member of PEN America. After Russia
 ’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022\, Olena traveled to P
 oland\, where she spent a year acting in the Polish-Ukrainian play Life in
  Case of War. Since March 2023\, she has been a Research Scholar at the Un
 iversity of Pittsburgh and a Writer-in-Residence at the City of Asylum Fel
 lowship for Ukrainian Writers.Christopher Rivas is quickly becoming one of
  the most sought-after multi-hyphenates as an actor\, author\, podcaster\,
  playwright\, and storyteller. His critically acclaimed debut book\, Brown
  Enough\, explores what it means to be Brown in America. The book is part 
 memoir and part social commentary\, a roller coaster of finding one’s tr
 ue self while simultaneously having a racial awakening amidst the struggle
  to be “perfectly” Latinx\, woke\, and as Brown as possible to make it
  in today’s America. His next book\, You’re a Good Swimmer\, is a chil
 dren’s book that’s due out in the summer of 2024. He’s also the host
  and executive producer of two podcasts with SiriusXM’s Stitcher: Brown 
 Enough\, which explores the parallel themes of this book through interview
 -style episodes\; and Rubirosa\, a 10-episode documentary-style investigat
 ion of Porfirio Rubirosa\, a Dominican diplomat\, race car driver\, soldie
 r\, and polo player who’s believed to be the inspiration for the famous 
 character James Bond. On screen\, Christopher is known for his work on the
  Fox series\, Call Me Kat\, opposite Mayim Bialik.Bold and visionary\, Les
 ya Verba is a Ukrainian-American creator whose work fuses wearable art\, m
 ultimedia performance\, and public murals. From fashion-forward paintings 
 on jackets and crowns to commanding murals in Odesa and Kyiv\, her voice i
 s unmistakable. She also composes and performs\, bringing ritual\, history
 \, and emotion into each performance and\nvisual piece. A catalyst of cult
 ural memory\, she lives in Brooklyn and continues to transform the world

  / $20 DOS 7PM DOORS / 8PM MUSIC ALL AGES  for fans of... Descendents\, Th
 e Chats\, FIDLAR\, Bad Nerves  BIO: Washington DC’s Teen Mortgage climbe
 d from the city’s primordial punk soup in 2017 after guitarist/vocalist 
 James Guile relocated to the nation's capital from Liverpool\, UK and by a
  stroke of luck was quickly able to find hard hitting drummer Ed Barkauska
 s via a desperate craigslist post. As a two piece they stood out - crossbr
 eeding east coast hardcore aggression and garage/surf sleaze with a focus 
 on pop sensibility. This sonic blend perfectly set the scene for vocalist 
 and guitarist James Guile to illustrate what he describes as “the absurd
 ity of living in the era of late stage capitalism and tech feudalism”. H
 e adds\, “it’s even woven into our name\, like Mortgage in latin means
  ‘death pledge’”   Teen Mortgage’s acerbic intensity was noticed b
 y Brooklyn\, NY label King Pizza Records\, who released the duo’s 2019 E
 P Life/Death and 2021’s Smoked. Songs from the EPs earned Teen Mortgage 
 placements with Shameless\, Vans Park Series\, and Evil Bikes and support 
 slots with notable bands like The Chats\, Mike Krol\, Bass Drum Of Death\,
  Jeff The  Brotherhood\, etc.    Known for their rowdy live shows\, Teen M
 ortgage detonates a sonic bomb that leaves no room for apathy\, let alone 
 time to breathe. Guile's caustic riffs and sneer paired with Barakauskas's
  brawn have fostered a new established meeting ground for those looking fo
 r a place to mosh. Their DIY headline national tours have seen crowd membe
 rs become rabid as soon as the pair kick in the first riff of the set\, li
 ke a pack of coyotes chasing down their prey. The group's infectious fuzz 
 bonded with Jello Biafra and George Carlin inspired lyrics ignite audience
 s into a primal frenzy\, sweating out the drudgery of living through\, onc
 e again in Guile's words\, "the era of late stage capitalism and tech feud
 alism".  “These guys have got it going on” - Iggy Pop\, BBC6’s The C
 onfidential Show

 rforming together since 2018\, The Erly has released four studio albums\, 
 including the newest in their catalog\, an 11-track americana rock album c
 alled ‘Salem Lights’ (9/4/24). Featuring each member on lead vocals\, 
 it contains narrative-driven lyrics that paint southern-gothic landscapes 
 amongst emotional\, rootsy playing. Born out of a jam sesh with intent to 
 create demos in Gleason’s basement\, ‘Salem Lights’ evolved into a c
 ompleted body of work. Produced by Paul Bennett\, the band describes the a
 lbum as\, “No metronome\, all the microphone bleed you can get\, and the
  true sound of The Erly working together in their natural state.” Though
  this album finds The Erly at their most relaxed\, they are no strangers t
 o creating a jam-adjacent live performance.

  BEING DEAD with support TBA  $18 ADV / $20 DOS 7PM DOORS / 8PM MUSIC ALL 
 AGES  for fans of... Water From Your Eyes\, Ty Segall\, Japandroids\, Osee
 s  BIO: Being Dead — the Austin\, TX-based duo consisting of Falcon Bitc
 h and Shmoofy — announces its new album\, EELS\, out September 27th on B
 ayonet\, lead single/video “Firefighters\,” and a fall headline tour. 
 Being Dead’s records are mosaics\, technicolor incantations\, each song 
 its own self-contained little universe. And while the dreamlike EELS probe
 s further into the depths of the duo Being Dead’s psyche\, it is\, most 
 importantly\, a 16-track record that is genuinely unpredictable from one t
 rack to the next. It’s a joyous and unexpected trip helmed by two true-b
 lue freak bitch besties holed up in a lil’ house in the heart of Austin\
 , Texas.  When Horses Would Run\, Being Dead’s “glorious and timeless
 ” (Gorilla vs. Bear) debut record released in 2023\, took years to relea
 se. The final product was excellent and expertly polished\, at odds with t
 he live rowdiness they’d cultivated a reputation for throughout Austin a
 nd beyond across seven years of being a band. For the next one\, they knew
  they’d have to do things differently. They decamped to Los Angeles for 
 two weeks to record with GRAMMY-winning producer John Congleton\, writing 
 songs for the record until days before they landed in the studio. Working 
 on a much tighter schedule than their debut LP\, the radical shift in proc
 ess was welcome - a good balance and a challenge\, with Congleton helping 
 them find new ways to work. Being Dead has grown from a duo to a trio live
 \, including bassist Nicole Roman-Johnston who also co-wrote and recorded 
 bass and vocals on several album tracks.  The resulting EELS is a darker r
 ecord\, tapped more into the devilishness within. It’s a more raucous\, 
 rougher ride sonically. There’s heartbreak\, excitement\, enchantment\, 
 dancing – we move through it all at a high-octane pace. Falcon Bitch and
  Smoofy never want to do the same thing twice on any song\, and they don
 ’t. This is never more apparent than on lead single\, “Firefighters\,
 ” which might be the first of its kind told from the perspective of a Da
 lmatian who is overworked at their fire station. The pummeling\, distorted
  garage rock ripper’s accompanying video by director URZULKA “came tog
 ether through a group hallucination.” The band adds\, “We love marbles
  and outdoor play and decided to get it on video for y’all. Making this 
 was like creating an intricate handshake with all your buddies—riddled w
 ith inside jokes and giggles.”

 DOORS / 8PM MUSIC ALL AGES  for fans of... Frog\, Saintseneca\, Merce Lemo
 n  ADVANCE BASE BIO: Advance Base is the melancholic soft rock recording p
 roject of Chicago\, IL singer/songwriter Owen Ashworth (formerly of Casiot
 one for the Painfully Alone). Using a two-handed arsenal of electric piano
 \, Omnichord\, samplers\, effect pedals & drum machines\, Ashworth builds 
 minimalist\, heavy-hearted\, & nostalgia-obsessed ballads around his conve
 rsational baritone. The warm\, electronic sound of Advance Base has been d
 escribed as "lo-fi\," "depressed" & "weirdly uplifting."   Animal Companio
 nship\, the third & most recent "studio" album by Advance Base\, was relea
 sed September 21\, 2018 by Run For Cover Records / Orindal Records. GoldFl
 akePaint & Various Small Flames both listed Animal Companionship among the
 ir favorite albums of 2018. Since then\, Advance Base has released Wall of
  Tears & Other-Songs I Didn't Write\, a home-recorded collection of (mostl
 y) country/Americana covers arranged for electronic instruments & Live at 
 Home\, a collection of mid-quarantine livestream concert performances & th
 e closest representation of an Advance Base live set commercially availabl
 e. A new single titled ”Little Sable Point Lighthouse” was released on
  March 31\, 2022.   “It’s with no exaggeration we describe Owen Ashwor
 th as one of the most consistent and important songwriters in contemporary
  indie music. From the earliest Casiotone For the Painfully Alone demos to
  most recent Advance Base single ‘Little Sable Point Lighthouse‘\, Owe
 n has crafted a catalogue of characters and circumstances with few rivals 
 in the modern era. His is an ever evolving body of work which stands out i
 n its deftness and humility and empathy and care\, bringing to life indivi
 duals from across the spectrum of human experience while remaining unerrin
 gly attuned to the tender\, fallible heart at the centre of each.” - Var
 ious Small Flames   "A Raymond Carver short story collection set to music 
 by a Joan of Arc-era OMD" - MOJO Magazine

 975\n   Judah Friedlander is a unique & versatile performer & has won awar
 ds and accolades as both a comedic actor & dramatic actor. He has been in 
 hundreds of television shows and over 40 feature films. For acting roles\,
  he has often done deep character work\, changing his appearance & voice s
 o much that he is unrecognizable - as he did in “American Splendor” fo
 r which he was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporti
 ng Actor. Judah is also well-known for playing the dirtbag with a heart of
  gold “Frank” for all 7 seasons on the multiple Emmy-winning TV comedy
  “30 Rock”.    Why'd We Book It? Judah Friedlander (and his many hats)
  have been making us laugh since 30 Rock (perhaps my favorite TV show of a
 ll time) - and although he may be be known for playing a juvenile comedy w
 riter (in a show full of them)\, his standup is anything but\; combining p
 olitical satire with absurdity\, and put through a freewheeling deadpan pe
 rsona unlike anyone else.   Extended Bio: Judah Friedlander’s stand-up c
 omedy is super funny. It is satire at its most creative\, incisive\, rebel
 lious\, and hilarious - and never preachy. It hilariously & profoundly sat
 irizes the propaganda of American exceptionalism\, empire\, imperialism\, 
 and oppression - through jokes and crowd work in a style all his own. He a
 lso does the same on a global scale\, not limiting his critique to the USA
 . And he also does some material and crowd work that is just comedy - not 
 necessarily of any political bend. His 84 minute stand-up comedy performan
 ce film from 2017\, which he independently produced\, directed\, edited\, 
 wrote\, and performed: “America Is the Greatest Country In the United St
 ates”\, won rave reviews\, with many critics & fans calling it the best 
 of the year\, and their favorite ever.   Judah has also authored two books
 : the riduclously funny instructional karate book “How To Beat Up Anybod
 y”\, and the absurd & satirical “If the Raindrops United”\, a collec
 tion of his drawings & cartoons. Judah is touring with all new material th
 at has not been released before on any album or special. He will be releas
 ing more stand-up comedy perfomance films soon. instagram: @judahworldcham

 their own homes\, with special attention to the intricacies of our ecosyst
 ems\, formed by both the natural world and our more-than-human kin\, as we
 ll as the people who make up our communities. It is a meditation on nature
 \, and the ways in which one might turn to the natural world to cultivate 
 one’s own wilderness and reimagine ways of being. About the Author:Juli

 hang’s Women\, Seated. The riveting story shines a spotlight on a powerf
 ul Chinese family’s fall from grace\, detailing a world of luxury\, weal
 th\, and around-the-clock service\, with secrets hidden in every shadow. F
 ull of drama and intrigue most American audiences are chomping at the bit 
 for\, one could almost forget that this bestseller likely wouldn’t have 
 made it to a front-of-store display without the work of editor Han Zhang a

  to the lives of an elite Chinese couple and their trusted nanny\, Yu Ling
 . Slipping in and out of the shadows\, meticulous in her care of their onl
 y son\, Yu Ling has served the family for years and knows all their secret
 s—and guards a few of her own.In the pressure-cooker political environme
 nt of China\, the fates of even the most powerful families can reverse ove
 rnight. When the family becomes the subject of a government investigation\
 , their fortunes crumble\, and their nanny is left to make a series of lif
 e-changing choices. But how far will she go to claim her due?In conversati
 on with Anderson Tepper\, City of Asylum’s curator for World Literature\

DESCRIPTION:https://cityofasylum.org/program/litfest-2025-booker-prize-winn
 er-kiran-desai/\nIn 2006\, author Kiran Desai won the Booker Prize for her
  novel The Inheritance of Loss. For nearly 20 years\, the world has been w
 aiting with bated breath for her next novel. Now it’s finally here\, it
 ’s The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny\, and it’s on the shortlist for t
 he 2025 Booker Prize. This October\, Kiran returns to City of Asylum for 
 the first time since 2022 to share this groundbreaking new novel with LitF
 est audiences\, in conversation with City of Asylum Curator for World Lite
 rature\, Anderson Tepper. The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny has been prais
 ed as “A transcendent triumph…not so much a novel as a marvel” (The 
 New York Times Book Review) and “[d]evastating\, lyrical\, and deeply ro
 mantic…an unmitigated joy to read” (Khaled Hosseini\, author of The Ki
 te Runner). When Sonia and Sunny first glimpse each other on an overnight
  train\, they are immediately captivated yet also embarrassed by the fact 
 that their grandparents had once tried to matchmake them\, a clumsy meddli
 ng that served only to drive Sonia and Sunny apart.The Loneliness of Sonia
  and Sunny is the sweeping tale of two young people navigating the many fo
 rces that shape their lives: country\, class\, race\, history\, and the co
 mplicated bonds that link one generation to the next. A love story\, a fam
 ily saga\, and a rich novel of ideas\, it is the most ambitious and accomp
 lished work yet by one of our greatest novelists.You can purchase a copy o
 f Kiran’s book\, The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny\, at City of Asylum B
 ookstore.About the Author:Kiran Desai is the bestselling author of two nov
 els\, Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard and The Inheritance of Loss\, which 
 won both the Booker Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award. Born

 featuring some of the most interesting academics in the city presenting th
 eir work in a good old fashion dive bar!  Our third edition of this very f
 un show is a special halloween edition\, featuring creepy crawlie caterpil
 lar's who love to wear costumes\, and the real world truth behind the Pira
 te costumes you'll see on many a trick-or-treater.   John Boonstra - Pitt 
 Professor "Pirates: History and Myth" Since ships have sailed the proverbi
 al seven seas\, pirates have sought to disrupt seaborne travel and trade. 
 And for just as long\, stories of pirates have circulated\, conjuring imag
 es of romantic\, dastardly\, or simply unscrupulous swashbucklers. What—
 if anything—do such representations have to do with actual historical pi
 rates? Why has the pirate loomed so large in the cultural imagination\, th
 en and now? What kind of threat has he (or she) represented? Why\, and to 
 whom? And how does this mythologized figure draw on\, diverge from\, or di
 stort the experiences of real-world pirates?  Kevin Keegan - Insect Collec
 tion Manager\, Carniege Museum of Natural History "Masters of Deception: U
 nbecoming a Caterpillar." When you close your eyes and think of a caterpil
 lar you probably imagine something like the caterpillar from The Very Hung
 ry Caterpillar\, but caterpillars are more than just green. From mimicry t
 o masquerading\, caterpillars have mastered the art of not looking like a 
 caterpillar to avoid the ever watching eyes of their most dogged predators
 : birds. Learn about the strategies caterpillars employ to live another da
 y\, and see amazing examples of caterpillar deception from cross-dressing 
 inchworms to bone-collecting cosmet moth caterpillars.  And open Q&As with
  both after!  PLUS! 100% of the ticket sales from this event will be donat
 ed back to the speakers research departments to help support their ongoing
  work!

 n-pittsburgh/\nFrom the outside\, it seems as though Steel City residents 
 have plenty to brag about\, from championed sports teams to a bustling jaz
 z history to our longtime designation as one of the most livable cities. B
 ut after a 2019 report by the City of Pittsburgh’s Gender Equity Commiss
 ion showed that Pittsburgh is among the worst cities for Black women to li
 ve in\, one is left questioning: Most livable for whom?What does a discove
 ry like this mean for Black women who live in Pittsburgh? What does it mea
 n for the Black women who decide to leave? With these questions in mind\, 
 poet Yona Harvey (You Don’t Have to Go to Mars for Love) and scholar Tah
 irah J. Walker (Rhetoric\, Intersectionality\, and Black Women in Pittsbur
 gh) will discuss their respective works and experiences\, exploring inters
 ectionality\, community\, and the triumphs and struggles of life in “the
  most livable city.”This program features an opening song by INEZ\, whos
 e work can be described as an audio diary of her navigation of love and gr
 owth as a Black woman. Then Yona and Tahriah will read from their respecti
 ve works and be in conversation. The poems of award-winning poet Yona Har
 vey’s much-anticipated You Don’t Have to Go to Mars for Love follow an
  unnamed protagonist on her multidimensional\, Afro-futuristic journey. Ha
 lf-superhero\, half-secret-identity\, she encounters side-slipping\, specu
 lative realities testing her in poems that appear like the panels of a com
 ic book. Music directs readers through large and small emotional arcs\, co
 nstantly re-troubled by lyric experimentation.In Rhetoric\, Intersectional
 ity\, and Black Women in Pittsburgh\, Tahirah J. Walker provides an analys
 is of how Black women in Pittsburgh navigate the public sphere through an 
 examination of the ways intersecting identities shape discourse\, silence\
 , and reclamation. Tahirah draws on historical events\, personal narrative
 s\, and community case studies to zoom in on the intersectional marginaliz
 ation\, resistance\, and transformation journeys of Black women in a city 
 deemed most unlivable for them. The book serves as both a testimony to the
  way intersectionality is turned on its head in Pittsburgh\, and as a love
  letter to every Black woman who has lived in this city and asked herself 
 why.About the Authors:Yona Harvey is the author of You Don’t Have to Go 
 to Mars for Love\, winner of The Believer Book Award in Poetry\, and Hemmi
 ng the Water\, winner of the Kate Tufts Discovery Award from Claremont Gra
 duate University and finalist for the Hurston/Wright Award. Between the pu
 blication of her first two poetry books\, Yona co-wrote Marvel Comics’ W
 orld of Wakanda\, earning an Eisner Award for best limited series\, and co
 -wrote the comic book series Black Panther & the Crew. Her third poetry co
 llection\, Season One\, Episode Seven\, is forthcoming in 2026.Tahirah J. 
 Walker is a writer and teacher whose work explores the intersections of Bl
 ack womanhood\, community\, and expression. She holds a doctorate in rheto
 rical studies and currently serves as chair of the Department of Community
  Engagement and Leadership at Point Park University in downtown Pittsburgh
 . Her work is influenced by the brilliance and insight of Yona Harvey\, Br
 ian Broome\, Deesha Philyaw\, Damon Young\, Tony Norman\, Kendra Ross\, an
 d INEZ. Tahirah endeavors to reflect the vibrant and unapologetic voices t
 hat make Pittsburgh feel like home. She is a two-time recipient of the Adv
 ancing Black Arts in Pittsburgh grant\, an honor that continues to shape a
 nd support her creative projects. Tahirah cherishes her family roles\, esp
 ecially those of mother and partner. She believes in exercising the power 
 of joy as resistance. Despite this fullness of heart\, she is still proces
 sing the tragic day when Beyoncé’s Renaissance tour stop in Pittsburgh 
 was canceled. She has moved forward with grace\, sarcasm\, and a healthy a
 mount of self-care items from her favorite shop\, Plants for Skin. Tahirah
  has lived in and around Pittsburgh for over 25 years.About Your Visit: T

DESCRIPTION:https://cityofasylum.org/program/litfest-2025-deaf-storytelling
 /\nPerhaps the most beautiful thing about language are the endless ways it
  can take shape\, from the spoken and written word to physical\, corporeal
  form. In this LitFest program\, City of Asylum welcomes Deaf storytellers
  and poets sharing work in American Sign Language (ASL) and Visual Vernacu
 lar (VV).While ASL is its own language\, with its own grammar structure se
 parate from English\, VV is a storytelling and poetic technique that comes
  to life through body language and facial expressions\, offering a more in
 terpretive means of expression with a feeling and vibe all its own. Each o
 f these language art forms seeks to expand and enrich the act of storytell
 ing\, proving that you do not need sound to create points of connection. 
 This program\, hosted by former ASL Poet Laureate of Allegheny County Mj S
 hahen\, features performances by two Pittsburgh-based storytellers—Kj Jo
 hnson and Val Wojton—as well as a longer storytelling performance by Bal
 timore-based Deaf comedian NuNu Davis. The performances will be followed 
 by an audience Q&A. Hearing folks are welcome! ASL interpretation to be p
 rovided by interpreters Heather Gray and Joshua Stresing.About the Artists
 :Antines “NuNu” Davis was born and raised in Baltimore\, Maryland. Whe
 n attending college in Minnesota\, she became the first Black Deaf female 
 to win the Miss Deaf Minnesota title in 1991. She loves to share ASL stori
 es with the Deaf community\, including having shared a few stories as part
  of the visionaries of the Creative Arts-ISM at the Atlas Performing Arts 
 Center. She is actively involved in several organizations in the Deaf comm
 unity\, such as Deaf Women of Color\, National Deaf People of Color\, and 
 the Baltimore Charter of the National Black Deaf.Maryjean (Mj) Shahen writ
 es poetry and then translates it into ASL. Previously\, Mj worked for year
 s as a counselor and trainer for Deaf-Blind and Deaf individuals with mult
 iple intellectual disabilities\, using various technologies and visual cue
 s for instruction and visual/tactual communication. She holds a BS from Ga
 llaudet University and an MS from Hofstra University\, and she served in t
 he Peace Corps in Kenya. Mj was also a judge and consultant for the TV gam
 e show SignTacTic. Currently\, Mj is the ASL Coordinator and an associate 
 professor at CCAC.About Your Visit: The in-house restaurant\, Cucina Alfa

DESCRIPTION:https://cityofasylum.org/program/litfest-2025-translation-slam/
 \nTwo translations enter. One translation leaves.City of Asylum is back wi
 th its third official Translation Slam! The slam is a thrilling phenomenon
  in which renowned translators compete to see who can produce the best tra
 nslation from the same source material. The source material is provided to
  the translators in advance\, but the true battle of wits begins on stage 
 at the slam\, when the translators present and defend their work under the
  scrutiny of the author\, the emcee\, and the audience. The magic of the 
 slam lies in the truth that literary translation is an art form—not an e
 xact science. Interpretations of a singular text are plentiful\, and no tw
 o translators will interact with a text in exactly the same way. In this p
 rogram\, City of Asylum Writer-in-Residence Volodymyr Rafeyenko has suppli
 ed a 600-word essay in Ukrainian\, which has been shared with literary tra
 nslators Mark Andryczyk (who has worked on several of Volodymyr’s litera
 ry projects) and Dominique Hoffman (who will take in Volodymyr’s work wi
 th fresh eyes). These experts in Ukrainian-to-English translation will pr
 epare their interpretations ahead of time and then go head-to-head live at
  the slam\, revealing their respective translations to the audience and to
  Volodymyr. At this point\, our translators will defend their work under t
 he scrutiny of the author\, the audience\, and our moderator\, Rania Mamou
 n. Their defenses and discussion will cover differences in word choice\, 
 the influence of translation on reader interpretation\, their translation 
 process and reasoning\, and what’s lost and gained in the art of transla
 tion. The slam will be followed by an audience Q&A. English/Ukrainian liv
 e interpretation will be provided by Myloslava Zavhorodnia.About the Autho
 r:Volodymyr Rafeyenko is an award-winning Ukrainian writer\, poet\, transl
 ator\, and literary and film critic from Kyiv\, Ukraine. He graduated from
  Donetsk University with a degree in Russian philology and culture studies
 . From 1992 to 2018\, he wrote his works in Russian\, was mainly published
  in Russia\, and was considered a representative of Russian literature. Fo
 llowing the outbreak of Russian aggression in Ukraine\, Volodymyr left Don
 etsk and moved to a town near Kyiv\, where he wrote Mondegreen: Songs abou
 t Death and Love\, his first novel in the Ukrainian language\, which was s
 hortlisted for the Taras Shevchenko National Prize—Ukraine’s highest a
 ward in arts and culture. Volodymyr learned Ukrainian from scratch and has
  dedicated himself to speaking Ukrainian\, rather than Russian\, his mothe
 r tongue\, as an act of resistance and perseverance. Among other recogniti
 ons\, he is the winner of the Volodymyr Korolenko Prize for the novel Brie
 f Farewell Book (1999) and the Visegrad Eastern Partnership Literary Award
  for the novel The Length of Days (2017). Volodymyr’s prose is full of p
 hantasmagorical images and storylines\, as well as explicit and implicit a
 llusions to well-known texts. He is sometimes called the “magical postmo
 dernist” due to the intertextuality and richness of his prose. He is a R
 esearch Scholar at the University of Pittsburgh and a Writer-in-Residence 
 at City of Asylum with his wife\, Olesia Rafeyenko\, since June 2023.About
  the Translators:Mark Andryczyk administers the Ukrainian Studies Program

 terature at its Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures. He has a P
 hD in Ukrainian Literature from the University of Toronto (2005). His mono

  the University of Toronto Press in 2012. Andryczyk is editor\, compiler\,
  and a translator of The White Chalk of Days\, the Contemporary Ukrainian 
 Literature Series Anthology (Academic Studies Press\, 2017)—republished 
 by Penguin in 2022 as Writing from Ukraine: Fiction\, Poetry and Essays si
 nce 1965. He has translated eleven essays by Yuri Andrukhovych for the awa
 rd-winning publication My Final Territory: Selected Essays (University of 
 Toronto Press\, 2018). He is the translator of Volodymyr Rafeyenko’s nov

  unique family team of Chip Dominick & then 16-year old Maleena Dominick\,
  Pittsburgh’s Chip & The Charge Ups quickly created an electrifying buzz
 .  Powerhouse drummer\, Nolan Allen\, joined the band in 2022 and the trio
  developed a unique style "that effortlessly meshes metal riffs with pop-p
 unk choruses” (Beaver County Times).  \n\nChip & The Charge Ups captivat
 es audiences with infectious songs\, a swaggy wardrobe\, fun choreography\
 , and ingenious mashups.  In early 2025\, the band was voted “Best Alter
 native Band” for the third consecutive year in the 14th annual Iron City
  Rocks Pittsburgh Music Awards.  Chip & The Charge Ups legacy and latest a
 lbum\, "What Happened to the Boy Next Door?\," has earned the band its mos
 t effusive reviews to date\, such as:\n\n“This is an album that shows of
 f a few clever tricks musically.  You’re not sure if you’re getting 19
 70’s anarchy or modern day teenagers.  Either way\, it works\, and gives
  the whole album the originality that it’s going to be remembered for.  
 Music like this is exactly what is needed right now.” – Power Play Mag
 azine\n\n"An acclaimed work that mixes contemporary and retro\, capable of
  conquering the most nostalgic audience and those looking for a newer soun
 d" – Headbangers News (Brazil)\n\n“Pittsburgh icons” – Pittsburgh 
 City Paper\n\nOne of “the city’s marquee acts” – Pittsburgh Post-G
 azette\n\nSome of the band's most electrifying performances have been deli
 vered at prominent music festivals and while opening for national acts inc
 luding Dirty Honey\, Dee Snider\, Nita Strauss\, and Liliac.\n\nChip & The
  Charge Ups’ Pittsburgh-themed holiday song\, “Black and Gold Christma
 s” has been featured on three network television stations\, put into rot
 ation on three radio stations\, reviewed by countless print and online pub
 lications\, and received hundreds of thousands of views of its music video
 .  “Paying Back the Devil” - the leadoff single from What Happened to 
 the Boy Next Door? – has been in regular rotation on 10 radio stations i
 n three states.  With the airplay from the latest album\, this raised the 
 total of Chip Dominick – one of Pennsylvania’s most prolific songwrite
 rs – to 32 songs having received FM radio airplay.  \,\n\nThe band took 
 their new sound further than ever in 2024\, performing shows across Pennsy
 lvania and Ohio\, including as a co-headliner in Cincinnati’s 17th annua
 l – and sold out - Kenny Ozzfest.  The band’s goals for 2025 are to pl
 ay the biggest shows in its hometown while expanding its footprint further
  across the US and to also release multiple singles.\n\nThis Event Is All

 25-618253\n  ANDREW DISMUKES - Andrew Dismukes is a stand up comedian\, wr
 iter and actor . This year\, he returned to “Saturday Night Live” for 
 his sixth season as a cast member after starting on the show as a staff wr
 iter in Season 43.   Why'd We Book It? Andrew Dismukes returns to SNL mid-
 season after delivering one of our favorite standup sets of any cast membe
 r last year. Since then he’s developed into a dependable favorite in Stu
 dio 8H - appearing in more sketches than anyone else in Season 50 of the v
 enerable program. He’s quickly carving out a niche that lives somewhere 
 in between the absurdity of Tim Robinson and the casual observation humor 
 of John Mulaney. That off-kilter but somehow relatable voice carries over 
 to his standup - where he made his bones in his pre-SNL days. We’re stok
 ed to be bringing him to Pittsburgh for 3 shows!   For Fans Of... John Mul
 aney\, Andy Samberg\, Tim Robinson   Extended Bio: He is a series regular 
 in the forthcoming Amazon animated original\, THE HOSPITAL\, alongside May
 a Rudolph\, Natasha Lyonne\, Kieran Culkin and more. Andrew started perfor
 ming stand up comedy in Austin\, TX while studying at the University of Te
 xas where he received a B.S. in radio\, television and film. He has perfor
 med all across North America and the UK. In 2017 he was named one of the N
 ew Faces at the Just For Laughs Festival. He’s also performed at the Moo

DESCRIPTION:https://www.poetrymillvale.com/event/the-minks/\nThe Minks are 
 part of Nashville’s psychedelic music scene\, heavy on the rock and roll
 . We’re talking low-down\, all the way\, purse-lipped\, eyes-shut\, head
 -whirling kind of groove. In 2015\, on a search for creative community\, N
 ikki Barber started the band based on the idea that “if you don’t crea
 te\, you’ll combust”. Just like a rock and roll circus\, you never kno
 w what you’re going to get\, but you know it’ll be good. The band’s 
 palpable sound has roots in every music fan’s top ten—from Lou to Patt
 i to Creedence to Hank – but blends them into something totally original
  and current. Mixed with raw\, jangly instrumentation and soulful sacchari
 ne vocals\, it’s as much a throwback as it is an answer to the often ove
 rlooked underbelly of Nashville’s rock and roll scene. Their most recent
  release “Creatures of Culture” was recorded in one of Nashville’s h
 istoric studios\, Creative Workshop\, produced by Robbie Crowell (Deer Tic
 k\, Midland). Look for them\, on tour forever\, spreading the gospel of le
 tting your hair down and having a good time.

 nthese things happen tour\nwith Carly Cosgrove and Riley!Thursday November
  20\, 2025Thunderbird Music Hall4053 Butler Street\, Pittsburgh\, PADoors 
 @ 7pmShow @ 8pmAGE RESTRICTION: All AgesThere’s something kinda magical 
 about naming your band saturdays at your place. Right off the bat\, it cal
 ls to mind images of collapsing onto a friend’s couch at the end of a lo
 ng week\, and the kind of nights that turn into stories you’ll tell for 
 years to come. For the band from Kalamazoo\, Michigan\, it’s more than j
 ust a name\; it’s what’s held them together through college and the st
 range process of becoming an adult. Whether unpacking tour burnout or the 
 shame of outgrowing your past\, they’re constantly rejecting irony in fa
 vor of something much bolder: sincerity.\nOn their upcoming second full-le
 ngth\, these things happen (out September 12)\, saturdays at your place ta
 ke everything that made their early material resonate—twinkly guitars\, 
 heart-on-sleeve songwriting\, a distinctly Midwestern ache—and stretch i
 t into something even more resonant. It’s a record about growing up with
 out growing cold\, and it’s also a testament to where they’re from\, b
 oth literally and musically\; proof that a band with strong hometown roots
  can still shake the ground.\nFormed by three friends who met at Western M
 ichigan University\, the band—Esden Stafne\, Gabe Wood \, and Mitch Guli
 sh—have always used music as a way to map the wretched trajectory of gro
 wing up. But on these things happen\, they’ve stopped asking for directi
 ons and started finding their own way through the chaos. The result is a h
 eartfelt\, emotionally chaotic and self-aware glimpse at adulthood in all 
 its many complexities.\nThere’s no greater meaning to unfold\, just happ
 enstance\, and similarly\, the album doesn’t offer listeners any new inf
 ormation on what to do once you’ve ascended into adulthood\; it simply p
 rovides a more relatable cushion.\nThe hype for saturdays at your place fi
 rst kicked off with their 2023 EP\, always cloudy\, and has since blossome
 d into a steadily-building wave of momentum. “tarot cards” instantly h
 ad fans on the hook with its undeniable melody and quirky pronunciation\, 
 but the entire record has since gone on to cement their place as one of th
 e most exciting modern emo bands around. And while always cloudy was a str
 ong introduction\, these things happen marks a decidedly more introspectiv
 e future for saturdays at your place\; it’s also the first music they’
 ve released since 2023.\nOverall\, these things happen isn’t an album th
 at provides many answers. Instead\, it’s a cathartic companion to surviv
 al with friends at your side\, gear in the trailer\, and enough hope to ke
 ep showing up. For saturdays at your place\, that’s enough.Ticket Tier I

DESCRIPTION:https://www.poetrymillvale.com/event/sean-tobin/\nBorn and rais
 ed on the New Jersey shore\, Sean Tobin was influenced by folk-singing tro
 ubadours and high-energy rockers alike. His high-energy performances and r
 ock-tinged releases are due mostly in part to his upbringing in the Jersey
  shore bar scene. Tobin honed his craft playing countless shows in dives\,
  clubs and basements\, as well as during his time busking on the streets o
 f Galway\, Ireland throughout 2015 and 2017.  He has performed at such fe
 stivals as SXSW\, Americanafest\, North2Shore\, and Frank Turner’s Lost 
 Evenings\, and has opened for the likes of Jason Isbell\, Rhett Miller\, a
 nd many more. His fifth album\, Seasick\, will be released on October 24\,
  2025.

DESCRIPTION:https://cityofasylum.org/program/on-topic-george-packer/\nCity 
 of Asylum’s On Topic series returns for the fall season with The Atlanti
 c staff writer George Packer. In this reading and discussion\, George shar
 es his new work—a foray into the realm of fiction titled The Emergency
 —and brings us a visionary novel that goes to the nerve center of what i
 t means to live in a time of fracture and upheaval.Praised by Ayad Akhtar 
 (Pulitzer Prize winner and author of Homeland Elegies) as a “robustly im
 agined political parable…at once a gripping adventure and a vivid portra
 it of a family riven by a changing world\,” The Emergency depicts an emp
 ire that has collapsed from boredom and loss of faith in itself. In it\, 
 Doctor Hugo Rustin\, chief surgeon at the Imperial College Hospital\, is i
 ncreasingly estranged from his city and his family—from his wife\, Annab
 elle\, who finds fulfillment in their changed community\, and especially f
 rom his teenage daughter\, Selva\, who has turned against her father’s v
 alues. When an incident at the hospital leads to Rustin’s disgrace\, he 
 seeks redemption in a quixotic and dangerous journey into the countryside\
 , with Selva as his companion\, just as the conflict between Burghers and 
 Yeomen is reaching a crisis.In the end\, The Emergency asks what we owe ea
 ch other across divided generations and classes—what common human bonds 
 remain when a society falls apart?You can purchase a copy of George’s bo
 ok\, The Emergency\, at City of Asylum Bookstore.About the Author:George P
 acker is an award-winning author and staff writer at The Atlantic. His nov
 el\, The Emergency\, has just been published by Farrar Straus Giroux. His

 Our Man: Richard Holbrooke and the End of the American Century (winner of

  is also the author of two novels and a play\, and he is the editor of a t
 wo-volume edition of the essays of George Orwell.About the Moderator:Adria
